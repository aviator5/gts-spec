# Global Type System (GTS) Specification

This document defines GTS — a simple, human-readable, globally unique identifier and referencing system for data type definitions (e.g., JSON Schemas) and data instances (e.g., JSON objects). It is specification-first, language-agnostic, and intentionally minimal, with primary focus on JSON and JSON Schema.

**Format Support**: GTS Types and GTS Instances can be represented in multiple formats including JSON, YAML, and TypeSpec. See the [examples directory](./examples/) for demonstrations in different formats.

The GTS identifiers are strings in a format like:

```
gts.<vendor>.<package>.<namespace>.<type>.v<MAJOR>[.<MINOR>]
```

They can be used instead of UUID, ULID, URN, JSON Schema URL, XML Namespace URI, or other notations for identification of various objects and schema definitions like:

- API data types and typed payloads (e.g. custom resource attributes)
- RPC contracts schemas
- API errors, headers and various semantics definitions
- Event catalogs, messages and stream topics
- Workflow categories and instances
- FaaS functions or actions contract definitions
- Policy objects (RBAC/ABAC/IAM)
- UI elements, schemas and forms
- Observability payloads (e.g. log formats)
- IoT/Edge telemetry data (e.g. device message formats)
- Warehouse/lake schemas
- Enumerations and references (e.g. enum id + description)
- ML/AI artifacts (e.g. model metadata or MCP tools declarations)
- Configuration-as-data templates and config instances
- Testing artifacts (e.g. golden records and fixtures)
- Database schemas
- Compliance and audit objects

Besides being a universal identifier, GTS provides concrete, production-ready capabilities that solve common architectural challenges for platform vendors and service providers integrating multiple third-party services under single control plane. In particular:

- **Extensible plugin architectures**: Third-party vendors can safely extend platform base types such as custom API fields, events, settings, configs, UI elements, user roles, licensing, etc.
- **Cross-vendor type safety**: Validate contracts (APIs, events, configs, etc.) across multiple vendors with automated compatibility checking in a middleware layer
- **Hybrid database storage**: Store base type fields in indexed columns for fast queries, vendor-specific extensions in JSON/JSONB—no schema migrations needed
- **Granular access control**: Use wildcard patterns and attribute-based policies for fine-grained type-based authorization (ABAC) without maintaining explicit lists
- **Human-readable debugging**: Identifiers encode vendor, package, namespace, and version—instantly comprehensible in logs and traces
- **Schema evolution without downtime**: Add optional fields, register new derived types, and deploy producers/consumers independently

See the [Practical Benefits for Service and Platform Vendors](#51-practical-benefits-for-service-and-platform-vendors) section for more details.

| 0.6 | Introduced well-known/anonymous instance term; defined field naming implementation recommendations |
| 0.7 | BREAKING: require $ref value to start with 'gts://'; strict rules for schema/instance distinction; prohibiting well-known instances without left-hand type segments  |
| 0.8beta1 | Add OP#12 (schema vs schema validation), unified validation endpoint (/validate-entity), and clarify instance -> schema and schema -> schema validation semantics for chained GTS IDs |
| 0.8beta2 | Introduce schema traits (`x-gts-traits-schema`, `x-gts-traits`) and OP#13 (schema traits validation) |
| 0.8 | Add alternate combined anonymous instance identifier format |
| 0.9 | Add `x-gts-final` and `x-gts-abstract` schema modifiers; enforce final/abstract semantics in OP#6 and OP#12 |
| 0.10 | BREAKING: terminology unified around GTS Type / GTS Instance; rename API fields `schema_id` → `type_id` (also `old_schema_id`/`new_schema_id`/`to_schema_id`/`selected_schema_id_field`); rename API field `is_schema` → `is_type` (type-definition vs instance discriminator); `type_id` MUST be a GTS Type Identifier or `null` — no longer falls back to JSON Schema dialect URL; rename endpoints `/validate-schema` → `/validate-type`, `/schemas` → `/types`; rename OP#12 'Schema vs Schema Validation' → 'Type Derivation Validation'; rename OpenAPI components `ValidateSchemaRequest` → `ValidateTypeRequest`, `SchemaRegister` → `TypeRegister`; rename example directories `examples/**/schemas/` → `examples/**/types/` (file extensions `.schema.json` retained); add Terminology section |
| 0.11 | Introduce term **GTS Type Schema** as the canonical definition of a GTS Type; remove the standalone `Schema` term from Terminology; rewrite `GTS Type` entry to name the abstract registered entity; rename `GTS Type Registry` → `GTS Registry` (registry now scopes both Type Schemas and well-known Instances). **Conformance tests for reference implementations** also updated: rename API endpoints `/validate-type` → `/validate-type-schema` and `/types` → `/type-schemas`; rename OpenAPI components `TypeRegister` → `TypeSchemaRegister`, `ValidateTypeRequest` → `ValidateTypeSchemaRequest`; rename request field `TypeSchemaRegister.schema` → `TypeSchemaRegister.type_schema`; rename helper `validate_type` → `validate_type_schema`. |
| 0.12 | BREAKING: reframe GTS Type Schemas as a dialect-agnostic JSON Schema extension; the prior `$defs MUST NOT` and post-Draft-07-keyword restrictions are dropped; derivation compatibility and the finality guard use the chained `$id` alone, `allOf`+`$ref` recommended but not required (ADR-0001). `x-gts-traits-schema` becomes a JSON Schema subschema (object/`true`/`false`); the registry chain-aggregates declarations along the `$id` chain via `allOf` (ADR-0002). Trait completeness is keyed on `x-gts-abstract` and enforced on non-abstract types against the materialized effective traits object (ADR-0003). Trait-value merge follows JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7396); cross-descendant locking moves to standard JSON Schema `const` in `x-gts-traits-schema` (ADR-0004). The four document-level keywords (`x-gts-final`, `x-gts-abstract`, `x-gts-traits-schema`, `x-gts-traits`) MUST appear at the schema top level and are rejected (fail fast) when nested in a subschema (§9.7.1, §9.11). |
| 0.13 | CORRECTION: Define compatibility through accepted-instance-set inclusion (§4.3) and separate **Type Derivation Compatibility** (§4.1, one-way) from **Type Schema Evolution Compatibility** (§4.2). This corrects OP#8 verdicts for unchanged inputs — notably for open content models, enums, and `const` identifier fields; implementations targeting 0.12 may need to update their compatibility checker. OP#8 reports the tri-state `compatible`, `incompatible`, or `unknown` for each relation, preserving an inconclusive check instead of conflating it with incompatibility. Tolerant-reader, casting, and default-materialization guarantees MUST be reported separately (§4.3). Content models are classified on the resolved effective schema, not on `additionalProperties` alone (§4.4). §4 restructured and renumbered; later sections unchanged. OP#8 conformance tests updated. |
| 0.14 | BREAKING: replace the kind-blind `x-gts-ref` with the kind-selecting pair `x-gts-type-ref` and `x-gts-instance-ref`; both stay rooted at their operand and add a kind check on the candidate (§9.6.3). The keywords are **assertions** composing through the declared dialect's applicators, so `anyOf` expresses deliberate dual acceptance. Operand grammar is fixed to three forms with explicit precedence — the reserved dynamic token `/$id` (resolves to the leaf Type Schema selected for the validation operation, giving dynamic rebinding through an authored `$ref`/`allOf`), a lexical JSON Pointer resolved against the authoring schema resource and required to yield a terminal literal string, and a `gts.…` literal (§9.6.2). Dropped from the operand language: the `./…` spelling, `/gts.…` as a literal, and operand indirection through another annotated subschema; `/$id` is rooted resolution, not equality. MINOR-version and wildcard matching are specified in §9.6.3 rather than delegated. `x-gts-ref` is removed and MUST be rejected, not ignored. §11.0 corrected to separate the four document-level keywords from the field-level reference keywords. Migration is by field intent — see [`adr/0005-x-gts-ref-kind-split.md`](adr/0005-x-gts-ref-kind-split.md); examples and conformance tests migrate under the same version. |

## Terminology

This specification uses the following terms with precise meanings:

- **GTS Type**: a type entity identified by a GTS Type Identifier and defined by a GTS Type Schema. A GTS Type may exist as a standalone document (e.g., a `*.schema.json` file), be exchanged between systems, or be stored in a GTS Registry.
- **GTS Type Identifier**: a canonical GTS identifier ending with `~` that identifies a GTS Type.
- **GTS Type Schema**: the canonical definition of a GTS Type — a JSON Schema document annotated with the GTS-specific keywords (`x-gts-*`), describing the type's instance shape, traits, and derivation.

  Implementations MAY accept alternative source forms (e.g., TypeSpec, YAML) provided they deterministically map to a canonical GTS Type Schema. The canonical form, used for interchange, validation, and registration, is the JSON Schema document.
- **GTS Registry**: a registry that stores and resolves GTS entities — Type Schemas and well-known Instances — by GTS Identifier.
- **GTS Instance**: a concrete object, value, or document that conforms to a GTS Type.
- **GTS Instance Identifier**: a GTS identifier without the trailing `~`, used to identify a well-known instance.

## 1. Motivation

The proliferation of distributed systems, microservices, and event-driven architectures has created a significant challenge in maintaining **data integrity**, **system interoperability**, and **type governance** across organizational boundaries and technology stacks.

Existing identification methods—such as opaque UUIDs, simple URLs (e.g. JSON Schema URLs), or proprietary naming conventions—fail to address the full spectrum of modern data management requirements. The **Global Type System (GTS)** is designed to solve these systemic issues by providing a simple, structured, and self-describing mechanism for identifying and referencing GTS Types and GTS Instances.

The primary value of GTS is to provide a single, universal identifier that is immediately useful for:

### 1.1 Unifying Data Governance and Interoperability

**Human- and Machine-Readable**: GTS identifiers are semantically meaningful, incorporating vendor, package, namespace, and version information directly into the ID. This makes them instantly comprehensible to developers, architects, and automated systems for logging, tracing, and debugging.

**Vendor and Domain Agnostic**: By supporting explicit vendor registration, GTS facilitates safe, cross-vendor data exchange (e.g., in event buses or plugin systems) while preventing naming collisions and ensuring the origin of a definition is clear.

### 1.2 Enforcing Type Safety and Extensibility

**Explicit Type/Instance Distinction**: The GTS naming format clearly separates a GTS Type from a concrete GTS Instance, enabling unambiguous type resolution and validation.

**Inheritance and Conformance Lineage**: The chained identifier system provides a robust, first-class mechanism for expressing type derivation and instance conformance. This is critical for ecosystems where third-parties must safely extend core types while guaranteeing compatibility with the base schema.

**Built-in Compatibility Checking**: By adopting a constrained Semantic Versioning model, GTS supports automated schema-compatibility checking between successive definitions of a type identity. Casting and application-level processing remain separate operational contracts.

### 1.3 Simplifying Policy and Tooling

**Granular Access Control**: The structured nature of the identifier enables the creation of coarse-grained access control policies using wildcard matching (e.g., granting a service permission to process all events from a specific vendor/package: gts.myvendor.accounting.*).

**Deterministic Opaque IDs**: GTS supports the deterministic derivation of UUIDs (v5), providing a stable, fixed-length key for database indexing and external system APIs where human-readability is not required, while maintaining a clear, auditable link back to the source type.

**Specification-First**: As a language- and format-agnostic specification (though prioritizing JSON/JSON Schema), GTS provides a stable foundation upon which robust, interchangeable validation and parsing tools can be built across any ecosystem.


## 2. Identifier Format

GTS identifiers name either a GTS Type or a GTS Instance. A single GTS identifier may also chain multiple identifiers to express inheritance/compatibility and an instance’s conformance lineage.

The GTS identifier is a string with total length of 1024 characters maximum.

### 2.1 Canonical form

- A single GTS Type Identifier:
  - `gts.<vendor>.<package>.<namespace>.<type>.v<MAJOR>[.<MINOR>]~`
  - Note the trailing `~` to denote a GTS Type Identifier.
- A single GTS Instance Identifier (object of given type):
  - Well-known instance: `gts.<vendor>.<package>.<namespace>.<type>.v<MAJOR>[.<MINOR>]~<vendor>.<package>.<namespace>.<type>.v<MAJOR>[.<MINOR>]`
  - Combined anonymous instance: `gts.<vendor>.<package>.<namespace>.<type>.v<MAJOR>[.<MINOR>]~<UUID>`
  - Well-known and combined anonymous instance identifiers MUST include a left-hand type segment in a chain (see 2.2 and 3.7).
  - Combined anonymous instance identifiers MUST include a UUID tail.
  - Note: no trailing `~` for instances. 

The `<vendor>` refers to a string code that indicates the origin of a given schema or instance definition. This can be valuable in systems that support cross-vendor data exchange, such as events or configuration files, especially in environments with deployable applications or plugins.

The `<package>` notation defines a module, plugin, or application provided by the vendor that contains the specified GTS definition.

The `<namespace>` specifies a category of GTS definitions within the package, and finally, the `<type>` defines the specific object type.

Segments must be lowercase ASCII letters, digits, and underscores; they must start with a letter or underscore: `[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*`. The single underscore `_` is reserved as a placeholder and may only be used for the `<namespace>` segment.

The `<vendor>`, `<package>`, `<namespace>`, and `<type>` segment tokens must not start with a digit.

Versioning uses semantic versioning constrained to major and optional minor: `v<MAJOR>[.<MINOR>]` where `<MAJOR>` and `<MINOR>` are non-negative integers, for example:
- `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~` - defines a base event type in the system
- `gts.x.core.events.type.v1.2~` - defines a specific edition v1.2 of the base event type

The `<UUID>` is a 128-bit identifier (e.g., a UUID v5) that is used to identify a specific anonymous instance of a type. It is generated using a deterministic algorithm based on the type identifier and the instance data.

**Examples** - The GTS identifier can be used for instance or type identifiers:
```bash
gts.x.idp.users.user.v1.0~ # defines ID of a schema of the user objects provided by vendor 'x' in scope of the package 'idp'
gts.x.mq.events.topic.v1~ # defines ID of a schema of the MQ topic stream provided by vendor 'x' in scope of the 'mq' (message queue) package

```

### 2.2 Chained identifiers

Multiple GTS identifiers can be chained with `~` to express derivation and conformance. The chain follows **left-to-right inheritance** semantics:

- Pattern: `gts.<segment1>~<segment2>~<segment3>`
- Where **<segment>** is a single GTS identifier segment: `<vendor>.<package>.<namespace>.<type>.v<MAJOR>[.<MINOR>]`
  - `<segment1>` is a **base type** (GTS Type Identifier ending with `~`)
  - `<segment2>` is a **derived/refined type** (GTS Type Identifier ending with `~`) that extends `<segment1>` with additional constraints or implementation-specific details. It MUST be compatible with `<segment1>`.
  - `<segment3>` is a **GTS Instance Identifier** (no trailing `~`) that conforms to `<segment2>`. By transitivity, it also conforms to `<segment1>`.

**Important:** Each type in the chain inherits from its immediate predecessor (left neighbor) and MUST maintain compatibility.

**Chaining rules:**
1. All elements except the rightmost MUST be type identifiers (conceptually ending with `~`).
2. The rightmost element determines the identifier's nature:
   - Ends with `~` → the whole identifier represents a **GTS Type**.
   - No trailing `~` → the whole identifier represents a **GTS Instance**.
3. The `gts.` prefix appears **only once** at the very beginning of the identifier string.
4. Segments after the first are considered relative identifiers and do not repeat the `gts.` prefix. (e.g., `gts.x.some.base.type.v1~vendor.app.some.derived.v1~`).
5. Use `_` as a placeholder when the namespace is not applicable

**Examples with explanations:**

``` bash
# Base type only (standalone schema)
gts.x.core.events.type.v1~

# Type `ven.app._.custom_event.v1` derives from base type `gts.x.core.events.type.v1`. Both are schemas (trailing `~`).
gts.x.core.events.type.v1~ven.app._.custom_event.v1~

# Instance `ven.app._.custom_event_topic.v1.2` (no trailing `~`) conforms to type `gts.x.core.events.topic.v1`. The identifier shows the full inheritance chain.
gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~ven.app._.custom_event_topic.v1.2
```

### 2.3 Formal Grammar (EBNF)

The complete GTS identifier syntax in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF):

```ebnf
(* Top-level identifier *)
gts-identifier = "gts." , gts-segment , ( chain-suffix-type | chain-suffix-instance | chain-suffix-anon-instance ) ;

(* Chained type ID ends with ~ *)
chain-suffix-type      = { "~" , gts-segment } , "~" ;

(* Chained instance ID MUST have at least one tilde separator and NO trailing tilde *)
chain-suffix-instance  = "~" , gts-segment , { "~" , gts-segment } ;

(* Combined anonymous instance ID ends with a UUID tail and NO trailing tilde *)
chain-suffix-anon-instance = { "~" , gts-segment } , "~" , uuid ;

(* Single GTS ID segment *)
gts-segment    = vendor , "." , package , "." , namespace , "." , type , "." , version ;

vendor         = segment ;
package        = segment ;
namespace      = segment ;
type           = segment ;

(* Segment: lowercase letters, digits, underscores; starts with letter or underscore *)
segment        = ( letter | "_" ) , { letter | digit | "_" } ;

(* Version: major.minor or major only *)
version        = "v" , major , [ "." , minor ] ;
major          = "0" | positive-integer ;
minor          = "0" | positive-integer ;

(* Primitives *)
positive-integer = non-zero-digit , { digit } ;
letter           = "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" | "j"
                 | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t"
                 | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z" ;
digit            = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
non-zero-digit   = "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;

(* UUID tail for combined anonymous instance identifiers *)
hex-digit        = digit | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" ;
uuid             = 8hex , "-" , 4hex , "-" , 4hex , "-" , 4hex , "-" , 12hex ;
8hex             = hex-digit , hex-digit , hex-digit , hex-digit , hex-digit , hex-digit , hex-digit , hex-digit ;
4hex             = hex-digit , hex-digit , hex-digit , hex-digit ;
12hex            = hex-digit , hex-digit , hex-digit , hex-digit , hex-digit , hex-digit , hex-digit , hex-digit , hex-digit , hex-digit , hex-digit , hex-digit ;
```

**Grammar notes:**

1. **Type vs Instance distinction**: A GTS identifier ending with `~` (final-tilde present) denotes a GTS Type. Without the trailing `~`, it denotes a GTS Instance.

2. **Chain interpretation**: In a chained identifier `gts.<gts-segment1>~<gts-segment2>~<gts-segment3>`, each `~` acts as a separator. All segments before the final segment MUST be types (conceptually ending with `~`). The final segment determines whether the entire identifier is a type or instance.

3. **Combined anonymous instance**: In a chained identifier of the form `gts.<gts-segment1>~...~<uuid>`, the UUID is the instance identifier tail. All segments before the UUID MUST be types (conceptually ending with `~`).

4. **Placeholder rule**: Use `_` (underscore) as a segment value when the namespace is not applicable. It is recommended to use the placeholder only for the `<namespace>` segment.

5. **Normalization**: GTS identifiers must be lowercase. Leading/trailing whitespace is not permitted. Canonical form has no optional spacing.

6. **Reserved prefix**: The `gts.` prefix is mandatory and reserved. Future versions may introduce alternative prefixes but will maintain backward compatibility.


## 3. Semantics and Capabilities

GTS identifiers enable the following operations and use cases:

### 3.1 Core Operations

1. **Global Identification**: Uniquely identify data types (JSON Schemas) and data instances (JSON objects) in a human-readable format across systems and vendors.

2. **Schema Resolution and Validation**:
   - For a type identifier (ending with `~`): resolve to the JSON Schema definition
   - For an instance identifier: extract the rightmost type from the chain and validate the object against that schema
   - Chain validation: optionally verify that each type in the chain is compatible with its predecessor

#### Validation semantics for GTS chained IDs (instance -> schema and schema -> schema)

GTS identifiers may be chained (e.g. `gts.A~B~C`). Validation MUST respect the left-to-right inheritance model and MUST preserve the compatibility guarantee (section 3.2).

- **Instance → schema validation** (validate an object instance):
  - The system MUST resolve the **rightmost type** in the identifier chain and validate the instance payload against that JSON Schema.
  - If the instance identifier includes a type chain (`A~B~<instance>`), validating against the rightmost type `B` MUST also imply conformance to all base types in the chain (by transitivity).
  - Implementations MAY additionally validate that each adjacent type pair in the chain is compatible (schema→schema validation), but the primary runtime instance validation target is always the rightmost type.

- **Schema → schema validation** (validate a derived schema against its predecessor schema):
  - Given a derived type identifier chain (e.g. `A~B~` or `A~B~C~`), the system MUST validate that each derived schema is compatible with its immediate predecessor in the chain.
  - The compatibility rule is: every valid instance of the derived schema MUST also be a valid instance of the base schema.
  - The derived schema MUST be written such that it does not invalidate this compatibility guarantee, regardless of how the parent's constraints are expressed: via `allOf` with a `$ref` to the parent (recommended, to avoid duplication of parent fields) or by re-declaring the parent's fields directly in the derived schema. See §11.0 for how GTS extends JSON Schema and [`adr/0001-derivation-form.md`](adr/0001-derivation-form.md) for the full discussion.

- **`additionalProperties` and adding new properties**:
  - If a base schema (or any schema in the inheritance chain) defines an object with `additionalProperties: false`, then derived schemas MUST NOT introduce new properties at that object level that would be rejected by the base schema.
  - Derived schemas MAY still tighten constraints of existing properties (e.g. reduce `maxLength`, narrow `enum`, increase `minimum`) and MAY further specify previously-open nested objects (e.g. base `payload: {"type":"object"}` and derived defines `payload.properties`). They MAY also introduce a property at a partially open level when the property's name and every value allowed by its schema satisfy the base level's undeclared-property constraints.
  - Because a closed object blocks new derived properties at that level while open and partially open models have different in-place evolution trade-offs (§4.5), the choice of content model is a deliberate authoring decision. See §4.4.1 for the trade-off and for the recommended closed-envelope/open-container shape.

3. **Type Schema Evolution Compatibility Checking**: Automatically determine whether successive definitions of one type identity are compatible (see section 4).

4. **Access Control Policies**: Build fine-grained or coarse-grained authorization rules using:
   - Exact identifier matching
   - Wildcard patterns (e.g., `gts.vendor.package.*`)
   - Chain-based isolation (e.g., restrict access to specific vendor's extensions)
   - See also ABAC use-cases in sections 3.3 and 3.4 below

5. **Extensible Type Systems**: Enable platforms where:
   - Base system types are defined by a core vendor
   - Third-party vendors extend base types with additional constraints
   - All validation guarantees are preserved through the inheritance chain
   - Type evolution is tracked explicitly through versioning

### 3.2 GTS Types Inheritance

GTS chained identifiers express type derivation through **left-to-right inheritance**. In a chain like `gts.A~B~C`:

- Type `B` extends type `A` by adding constraints or refining field definitions
- Type `C` further extends type `B` in the same manner
- Each derived type MUST satisfy **Type Derivation Compatibility** with its predecessor (§3.1, §4.1)

**Derivation compatibility guarantee**: Every valid instance of a derived type is also a valid instance of all its base types in the chain. This is a one-way relation, not version compatibility in the sense of §4.3. This means:
- An instance conforming to `C` also conforms to `B` and `A`
- Validation against the rightmost type automatically ensures conformance to all base types
- Derived types can declare and constrain properties the base left open, tighten existing constraints, or provide more specific definitions—never loosen what a base accepts

This inheritance model enables safe extensibility: third-party vendors can extend platform base types while preserving conformance to the core system.

**Schema modifiers**: Schemas may optionally declare `"x-gts-final": true` to prohibit further derivation, or `"x-gts-abstract": true` to require that instances use a concrete derived type rather than the base type directly. See section 9.11 for full semantics.

**Implementation pattern: Hybrid storage for extensible schemas**

GTS types inheritance enables a powerful database design pattern that combines **structured storage** for base type fields with **flexible JSON storage** for derived type extensions. This approach provides:

- **Query performance**: Index and query base type fields using native database types
- **Extensibility**: Store vendor-specific extensions as JSON/JSONB without schema migrations
- **Type safety**: Validate all data against registered GTS schemas before storage
- **Multi-tenancy**: Support multiple vendors extending the same base type in a single table

**Example: Event Management Platform**

A platform defines a base event schema with common fields:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "id": { "type": "string" },
    "typeId": { "type": "string" },
    "occurredAt": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time" },
    "payload": { "type": "object", "additionalProperties": true }
  },
  "required": ["id", "typeId", "occurredAt", "payload"]
}
```

A third-party vendor (ABC) registers a derived event type for order placement:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~abc.events.order_placed.v1~", // define a new event type derived from the base event type
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~" }, // inherit base event schema
    {
      "properties": {
        "typeId": { "const": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~abc.orders.order_placed.v1~" },
        "payload": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": { // define the payload structure specific for this new event type
            "orderId": { "type": "string" },
            "customerId": { "type": "string" },
            "totalAmount": { "type": "number" },
            "items": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object" } }
          },
          "required": ["orderId", "customerId", "totalAmount", "items"],
          "additionalProperties": false
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The platform stores all events in a single table using hybrid storage:

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,     -- Indexed for fast event fetch by ID
    type_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,   -- Indexed for filtering by event type
    occurred_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,  -- Indexed for time-range queries
    payload JSONB NOT NULL,          -- Vendor-specific extensions stored as JSON
    INDEX idx_type_occurred (type_id, occurred_at)
);
```

**Benefits of this approach:**

1. **No schema migrations**: New event types are registered via GTS schemas, not database DDL
2. **Efficient queries**: Filter by `type_id` or `occurred_at` using indexes, then parse `payload` only for matching rows
3. **Vendor isolation**: Use `type_id` patterns (e.g., `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~abc.*`) for access control (see 3.5)
4. **Full validation**: All events are validated against their registered GTS schema before insertion, ensuring data quality despite flexible storage


### 3.3 Query Language

GTS Query Language is a compact predicate syntax, inspired by XPath/JSONPath, that lets you constrain results by attributes. Attach a square-bracketed clause to a GTS identifier containing name="value" pairs separated by commas. Example form: <gts>[ attr="value", other="value2" ].

> **Scope note:** The query language and attribute selector (section 3.4) are runtime conveniences for filtering and accessing data in GTS-aware applications. They are **not part of the core GTS identifier specification** and should not be embedded in stored identifiers or schema definitions. Use them only in runtime queries, policy evaluation, and data access operations.

Predicates can reference plain literals or GTS-formatted values, e.g.:

```bash
# filter all events that are published to the topic "some_topic" by the vendor "z"
gts.x.core.events.type.v1~[type_id="gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~z.app._.some_topic.v1~"]
# filter all user settings that were defined for users if type is z-vendor app_admin
gts.x.core.acm.user_setting.v1~[user_type="gts.x.core.acm.user.v1~z.app._.app_admin.v1~"]
```

Multiple parameters are combined with logical AND to further restrict the result set:

```bash
gts.x.y.z.type.v1~[foo="bar", id="ef275d2b-9f21-4856-8c3b-5b5445dba17d"]
```

### 3.4 Attribute selector

GTS includes a lightweight attribute accessor, akin to JSONPath dot notation, to read a single value from a bound instance. Append `@` to the identifier and provide a property path, e.g., <gts>@<root>.<nested>.

The selector always resolves from the instance root and returns one attribute per query. For example:

```bash
# refer to the value of the message identifier
gts.x.y.z.message.v1@id
```

Nested attributes also can be accessed within the instance's structure. For example:
```bash
# refer to the value of the 'bar' item property from the 'foo' field
gts.x.y.z.message.v1.0@foo.bar
```

### 3.5 Access control with wildcards

Wildcards (`*`) enable policy scopes that cover families of identifiers (e.g., entire vendor/package trees) rather than single, exact instance or schema IDs. This is useful in RBAC/ABAC style engines and relationship-based systems (e.g., Zanzibar-like models) where permissions are expressed over sets of resources.

```bash
# grants access to all the audit events category defined by the vendor 'xyz'
gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core._.audit_event.v1~xyz.*
# grants access to all the menu items referring screens of the vendor 'abc'
gts.x.ui.left_menu.menu_item.v1[screen_type="gts.x.ui.core_ui.screens.v1~abc.*"]
```

### 3.6 Access Control Implementation Notes

> **Scope disclaimer:** GTS-based access control implementation is outside the scope of this specification and will vary across systems. GTS provides the syntax to express authorization rules; however, different policy engines may apply different evaluation strategies or may not support attribute-based or wildcard-based access control at all.

The following guidance is provided for implementers building GTS-aware policy engines:

**Policy management domain model:**
- **Principal**: Users, services, or groups (outside the scope of GTS) mapped to roles.
- **Resource**: GTS identifiers or patterns (with wildcards and, optionally, attribute predicates) that denote types or instances.
- **Action**: Verbs such as `read`, `write`, `emit`, `subscribe`, `admin` defined by the platform.

**Example policy shapes:**
- **RBAC-style allow**: Role `xyz_auditor` → allow `read` on `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core._.audit_event.v1~xyz.*`
- **ABAC refinement**: Attach predicate filters like `[screen_type="..."]` to restrict by referenced type.
- **Derived-type envelopes**: Grant access at the base type (e.g., `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~`) so that derived schemas remain covered if they conform by chain rules.

**Matching semantics options:**
- **Implicit derived-type coverage (recommended)**: Granting access to a base GTS Type Identifier without an explicit wildcard (e.g., `gts.a.b.c.d.v1~`) SHOULD be treated as an implicit grant to all derived types and instances under that base type (equivalent in intent to `gts.a.b.c.d.v1~*`).

  Example candidate: `gts.a.b.c.d.v1~w.x.y.z.v1`

  This candidate SHOULD match all of:
  - `gts.a.b.c.d.v1~`
  - `gts.a.b.c.d.v1~*`
  - `gts.a.b.c.d.v1~w.*`

  But it SHOULD NOT match:
  - `gts.a.b.c.d.v1~x.*`
- **Segment-wise prefixing**: The `*` wildcard can match any valid content of the target segment and its suffix hierarchy, enabling vendor/package/namespace/type grouping.
- **Chain awareness**: Patterns may target the base segment, derived segments, or instance tail; evaluation should consider the entire chain when present.
- **Attribute filters**: Optional `[name="value", ...]` predicates further constrain matches (e.g., only instances referencing a specific `name`).
- **Minor version semantics**: Patterns without minor versions (e.g., `gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v1~*`) match candidates with any minor version of that major version (e.g., `v1.0~`, `v1.1~`), since the minor version is optional and omitting it means "any minor version". See section 10 for detailed examples.

**Evaluation guidelines:**
- **Deny-over-allow (recommended)**: If your engine supports explicit denies, process them before allows to prevent privilege escalation.
- **Most-specific wins**: Prefer the most specific matching rule (longest concrete prefix, fewest wildcards, most predicates).
- **Version safety**: Consider pinning MAJOR and, optionally, MINOR versions in sensitive paths; otherwise rely on Type Schema Evolution Compatibility guarantees (see section 4).
- **Tenant isolation**: Use vendor/package scoping to isolate tenants and applications; avoid cross-vendor wildcards unless explicitly required.

**Performance guidelines:**
- **Indexing**: Normalize and index rules by canonical GTS prefix to avoid expensive pattern-matching scans.
- **Caching**: Cache resolution results for common patterns and predicate evaluations; invalidate caches on schema or policy changes.
- **Auditing**: Log the concrete identifier and the matched rule (pattern + predicates) for traceability and compliance.

### 3.7 Well-known and Anonymous Instances

In GTS, a **GTS Type is always named**: it has a stable **GTS Type Identifier** (ends with `~`) and can be referenced from a JSON Schema `$id`.

However, a **GTS Instance** may be represented in two common ways:

- **Well-known instance (named)**: used for unique, globally-defined objects that benefit from a stable human-readable name (catalog entries, topics/streams, modules, capabilities, etc.).
  - **Mandatory**: well-known GTS Instance Identifiers MUST be expressed as a **chain** where the left segment is the type and the rightmost segment is the instance name. Single-segment instance identifiers (without a left-hand type segment) are prohibited.
  - Example (well-known topic/stream instance):
    - `gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~x.commerce._.orders.v1.0`
  - Field naming: typically `id` (alternatives: `gtsId`, `gts_id`).

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~x.commerce._.orders.v1.0",
  "name": "orders",
  "description": "Order lifecycle events topic"
}
```

- **Anonymous instance**: used for runtime-created objects where a globally meaningful name is not required (events/messages, DB rows, audit records, etc.).
  - Recommended: use an opaque identifier as `id` (typically a UUID) and store the associated **GTS Type Identifier** separately (e.g., in a `type` field).
  - Example (anonymous event instance):
    - `id: "7a1d2f34-5678-49ab-9012-abcdef123456"`, `type: "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.0~"`
  - Field naming: `type` (alternatives: `gtsType`, `gts_type`).

  Some services may also support a **combined** anonymous instance representation:
  - `id: "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.0~7a1d2f34-5678-49ab-9012-abcdef123456"`
  - In this case, the explicit `type` field MAY be omitted, since the GTS Type Identifier can be derived from the `id` prefix up to the final `~`.

**Note:** A type marked with `"x-gts-abstract": true` cannot have direct instances (well-known or anonymous). Instances must reference a concrete (non-abstract) derived type as the rightmost type in the chain. See section 9.11.

This split is common in event systems: **topics/streams** are often well-known instances, while individual **events** are anonymous. See `./examples/events` and the field-level recommendations in section **9.1**.

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "7a1d2f34-5678-49ab-9012-abcdef123456",
  "type": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.0~",
  "occurredAt": "2025-09-20T18:35:00Z"
}
```

## 4. Type Derivation and Schema Evolution

GTS defines two distinct compatibility relations. They hold between different pairs of schemas, run in opposite directions, and therefore permit opposite changes. Conflating them is the most common source of error when reasoning about a GTS type.

Compatibility is determined by comparing which JSON instances each schema accepts. In the table below, `Valid(S)` means all JSON instances accepted by schema `S` under the JSON Schema dialect declared by that schema (§4.3).

| | Type Derivation Compatibility (§4.1) | Type Schema Evolution Compatibility (§4.2) |
|---|---|---|
| Holds between | a derived type and each of its base types | successive definitions of one type identity |
| Relation | `Valid(derived) ⊆ Valid(base)` | selected mode: backward, forward, or full (§4.3) |
| Direction | one-way, always | chosen per type identity |
| Permits | declaring properties a base left open, tightening constraints | depends on the selected mode |

§4.3 defines the backward, forward, and full modes using this notation.

### 4.1 Type Derivation Compatibility

A derived type such as `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.0~` must satisfy **Type Derivation Compatibility** with its base type `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~`: every instance valid against the derived schema must also be valid against the base schema, that is `Valid(derived) ⊆ Valid(base)`.

This relation is one-way and unconditional. It is not selected per type and is never qualified by a mode name: a derived type is not "backward" or "fully" compatible with its base, it either satisfies Type Derivation Compatibility or it does not.

The normative validation rules for derivation, including which changes a derived schema may make and the `additionalProperties` restriction, are given in §3.1. §3.2 describes the resulting inheritance model.

### 4.2 Type Schema Evolution Compatibility

GTS uses semantic versioning with MAJOR and optional MINOR components. When a single type identity gains a new definition, the required guarantee depends on the chosen strategy.

Two shapes are permitted, and §6 leaves the choice between them to the implementation:

* **A new MINOR version.** The previous definition remains addressable under its own GTS Type Identifier and the successor takes the next minor, for example `v1.0` → `v1.1`. Because both definitions are addressable, OP#8 and the registry contract can check them directly.
* **Replacement under the same identifier.** The implementation treats the definition as mutable, which §6 lists as implementation-defined, and publishes the new definition under an unchanged identifier. Where the identifier carries no minor version at all, which §2.1 permits, whether the new MINOR strategy is available instead depends on registry policy: this specification does not define the relationship between a definition published under `v1~` and definitions published under `v1.0~`, `v1.1~`, and so on.

The compatibility relation is the same in both shapes. It holds between two schema definitions and does not depend on how they are addressed. What differs is addressability: where a definition is replaced in place, the two definitions are not simultaneously addressable by GTS Type Identifier, so the conformance API cannot express the check and the implementation is responsible for its own revision addressing and history semantics.

Replacing a base definition in place under an unchanged identifier may also change the effective schemas of every descendant that resolves that identifier. Because definition mutability is implementation-defined (§6), an implementation that permits this must define whether it revalidates descendants, invalidates them, or prevents the replacement while dependants exist. Publishing a distinct MINOR base identifier does not retroactively alter descendants that remain bound to the previous identifier.

- **MAJOR version increments** (v1 → v2): Always indicate breaking changes
- **Successive definitions within one MAJOR** (a new MINOR version, or a new revision of the same identifier): Must maintain compatibility according to one of three strategies: backward, forward, or full compatibility

The compatibility mode for Type Schema evolution is **implementation-defined** and can vary depending on system component implementing the API or DB storage, namespace or use case. For example:
- Event schemas might use **forward compatibility** (old consumers can read new events)
- API request payloads might use **backward compatibility** (new servers can process old requests)
- Configuration schemas might require **full compatibility** (any version can read any other)

### 4.3 Compatibility Modes

`Valid(S)` means all JSON instances accepted by schema `S` under the JSON Schema dialect declared by that schema. The compatibility modes compare what the old and new schemas accept:

**Backward Compatibility**: `Valid(old) ⊆ Valid(new)`. A consumer validating with the **new schema** accepts every instance valid under the **old schema**.
- **Use case**: Consumers can be updated before producers (e.g., API servers before clients for request payloads).
- **Validation consequence**: the new schema validates every instance that was valid under the old schema. Whether code compiled against the new schema can *process* old data is an operational property outside this relation.

**Forward Compatibility**: `Valid(new) ⊆ Valid(old)`. A consumer validating with the **old schema** accepts every instance valid under the **new schema**.
- **Use case**: Producers are updated before consumers, or to support rollback scenarios.
- **Validation consequence**: the old schema validates every instance that is valid under the new schema. Whether code compiled against the old schema can *process* new data is an operational property outside this relation.

**Full Compatibility**: `Valid(old) = Valid(new)`. Changes are both backward and forward compatible.
- **Use case**: Producers and consumers can be deployed in any order.
- **Validation consequence**: both schemas validate exactly the same instances, so no deployment order can produce a validation failure caused by the schema change. Whether application code behaves identically under both definitions is an operational property outside this relation. This is the safest but most restrictive evolution path.

JSON Schema annotation keywords such as `description`, `examples`, and `default` do not change `Valid(S)`. In particular, `default` does not insert a missing property during JSON Schema validation. An application may materialize defaults as a separate processing step, but compatibility results that rely on that behavior MUST identify it as an additional runtime contract.

> **Implementation note**: The compatibility mode enforced for publication is implementation-defined and outside the scope of this specification. Systems may enforce different modes for different identifier namespaces. Implementations MAY additionally certify operational compatibility based on a constrained producer model, tolerant readers, casting, or default materialization, but MUST report that separately from the schema compatibility defined above.

### 4.4 JSON Schema Content Models

Whether an object accepts undeclared properties is critical for compatibility. The content model is a property of the **fully resolved effective schema** at one object level — after `$ref` resolution and `allOf` composition — not of a single keyword in the authored document:

- **Open content model**: the resolved schema accepts an undeclared property with any value.
- **Closed content model**: the resolved schema rejects every undeclared property.
- **Partially open content model**: the resolved schema accepts some undeclared property names or constrains their values, for example through a nontrivial constraining schema-valued `additionalProperties`, `patternProperties`, or `propertyNames`.

`additionalProperties` is the usual way to set this, but it is not the only one. Because GTS is dialect-agnostic (§11), `unevaluatedProperties` can close an object whose `additionalProperties` is omitted, and a conjunctive subschema reached through `allOf` or `$ref` can close a level that looks open in isolation. A nontrivial constraining schema-valued `additionalProperties` can make the level partially open; a subschema equivalent to `true` (for example `{}`) or `false` (for example `{"not": {}}`) instead contributes a fully open or closed model, respectively, unless another constraint changes the effective result. Implementations MUST classify the level from the resolved effective schema.

The rules below are stated for the open and closed cases. They apply only where no other keyword constrains undeclared properties at that level; for a partially open level, compare directly which JSON instances the old and new schemas accept under §4.3 rather than reading a verdict off the table.

These models affect which changes are safe:
- Adding an **optional** field to a **closed** model is backward compatible (old instances carry no extra fields, and the new schema accepts the field's absence). Adding a **required** field is not backward compatible in either content model.
- Adding an optional property schema to an **open** model is forward compatible but not necessarily backward compatible: the old schema may have accepted arbitrary values under that property name which the new property schema rejects.
- Removing an optional property schema from an **open** model is backward compatible but not necessarily forward compatible: the new schema permits arbitrary values under that property name which the old property schema may reject.

A producer convention such as “do not emit undeclared properties”, combined with readers that safely ignore unknown fields, can make these open-model changes operationally safe in both deployment directions. That is a tolerant-reader contract, not full JSON Schema compatibility.

#### 4.4.1 Content Model, Derivation, and Evolution

The content model of an object level serves two different goals, and at that same level the two goals pull in opposite directions:

- **Extension by derivation** (§3.1, *`additionalProperties` and adding new properties*): a closed effective content model prevents derived types from introducing new properties at that object level. A fully open model permits such additions, while a partially open model permits them when each introduced property name and every value accepted by its derived property schema are also accepted as undeclared by the base model. For example, a base with `additionalProperties: {"type": "string"}` permits a derived declaration `foo: {"type": "string", "maxLength": 5}`.
- **Type Schema evolution** (§4.2): by the open-model rule above, adding an optional property to an open object is not necessarily backward compatible — the old schema already accepted arbitrary values under that name. Adding optional properties in place therefore works most cleanly when the object is closed.

Both goals are legitimate and neither content model is wrong. The choice is an authoring decision to make per object level:

| What should happen at this object level | Content model that supports it |
|---|---|
| Derived types introduce their own properties here | open, or partially open with compatible property names and schemas |
| Later definitions of this type add optional properties here | closed |
| Both | separate the levels — see the recommended pattern below |
| Neither; the shape is stable | either, though closed states the intent more precisely |

**Recommended pattern: closed envelope with designated open containers.** When a type should be both derivable and evolvable, the two goals need not be traded off against each other — they can be assigned to different object levels. The type closes its own top level and declares one or more explicitly open objects as extension points:

```jsonc
{
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["id", "type", "timestamp"],
  "properties": {
    "id": { "type": "string" },
    "type": { "type": "string" },
    "timestamp": { "type": "integer" },
    "payload": { "type": "object", "additionalProperties": true }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

The closed top level lets later definitions add optional envelope properties backward compatibly. The open `payload` lets derived types describe their own content without being rejected by the base. The base event schema in §4.6.2 and the examples in §5.2 use this shape.

A derived type MAY also declare the contents of an open container and close it: closing an open object makes the schema accept fewer instances, so it satisfies Type Derivation Compatibility, and §3.1 restricts only the *addition* of properties at a level a base has already closed. Having closed that level, the derived type regains in-place evolvability there, at the cost that its own descendants can no longer add properties there.

This is a recommendation, not a requirement; other content model choices remain valid. What matters is that the interaction is decided when the type is first published, rather than discovered at the first successive definition that fails a compatibility check.

### 4.5 Type Schema Evolution Compatibility Rules

The table below shows which schema changes between successive definitions of the same type identity are safe for each compatibility mode. It states the typical consequences of §4.3; §4.3 remains the normative definition, and a verdict that disagrees with a direct comparison of the accepted-instance sets is resolved in favour of §4.3.

The table assumes the object level in question is fully open or fully closed as defined in §4.4; for a partially open level, compare directly which JSON instances the old and new schemas accept. It further assumes that both schemas are satisfiable, that the listed change is the only semantic difference between the two definitions, that no other constraint masks it, and that it does in fact change the set of accepted instances. Where those assumptions do not hold, a `❌ No` verdict means "not guaranteed" rather than "impossible": adding an optional property whose subschema is `true` to an open object, or one whose subschema is `false` to a closed object, changes no accepted instance at all and is therefore fully compatible.

> NOTE: The table below illustrates Type Schema Evolution Compatibility, between successive definitions of one type identity. Type Derivation Compatibility is a separate relation, defined in §3.1 and §4.

Rows are grouped by the kind of change, so that variants of one change — open versus closed content model, optional versus required property, widening versus narrowing — sit next to each other and the difference in verdicts is visible at a glance.

| Change | Backward | Forward | Full | Notes |
|--------|----------|---------|------|-------|
| **Updating description/examples** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Documentation changes don't affect validation. |
| **Updating a referenced GTS type** | Depends | Depends | Depends | Compare the effective resolved schemas. The verdict does not follow from the compatibility of the referenced targets alone: a surrounding constraint can mask a difference between them. |
| **Adding optional property (open model)** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | The old open schema accepts every value allowed by the new property schema, but may have accepted incompatible values under the same name. |
| **Adding optional property (closed model)** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | Every old instance omits the property and the new schema accepts its absence. The old closed schema rejects a new instance that carries it. |
| **Adding new required property (open model)** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Old instances may lack the property; every new instance includes a value accepted by the old open schema. |
| **Adding new required property (closed model)** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | Old instances may lack the property and the old closed schema rejects the new property. |
| **Removing optional property (open model)** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | The new open schema accepts old values, but it may now accept values for that property which the old property schema rejected. |
| **Removing optional property (closed model)** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | The new closed schema rejects an old instance that carries the property. Every new instance omits it and the old schema accepts its absence. |
| **Removing required property definition (open model)** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | The new open schema accepts old instances, but may omit the property or accept values the old definition rejected. |
| **Removing required property definition (closed model)** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | New closed schema rejects old instances containing the property; new instances may omit a property required by the old schema. |
| **Closing an open object (`additionalProperties: true` → `false`)** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | The new schema rejects the undeclared properties an old instance may carry. Every new instance is valid under the more permissive old schema. |
| **Opening a closed object (`additionalProperties: false` → `true`)** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | The new schema accepts every old instance. The old closed schema rejects a new instance that carries an undeclared property. |
| **Changing required property to optional** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | Every old instance provides the property and the new schema still accepts it. The old schema rejects the new instances that omit it. |
| **Changing optional property to required** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | An old instance may omit the property, which the new schema rejects. Every new instance provides it and the old schema accepts it. |
| **Adding new enum value** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | The new enum accepts every old value. The old enum rejects the added value. |
| **Removing enum value** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Old data may contain the removed value, while every new value remains valid for the old enum. |
| **Changing a `const` value (e.g. an identity field)** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | The two `const` values differ, so no instance that carries the constrained property satisfies both schemas; where the property is required, the two schemas share no valid instance at all. OP#9 casting may rewrite such a field, which MUST be reported separately from schema compatibility (§4.6.3). |
| **Widening numeric type (int → number)** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | Every integer is valid under `number`. The old schema rejects the non-integer values the new schema now admits. |
| **Narrowing numeric type (number → int)** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | The old schema accepts every integer. The new schema rejects the non-integer values the old schema admitted. |
| **Relaxing constraints (e.g., increasing max)** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | Every instance valid under the tighter old constraint stays valid. The old schema rejects the values only the relaxed constraint admits. |
| **Tightening constraints (e.g., decreasing max)** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | The old schema accepts every instance valid under the tightened constraint. The new schema rejects old values outside the new limits. |
| **Renaming property** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | Breaking change: equivalent to remove + add. |

### 4.6 Compatibility Examples

This section demonstrates how different types of schema changes affect compatibility between successive definitions of the same GTS type. We take as example Event Management system and typical events structure, however it can be used for any other data schemas in the system

#### 4.6.1 Forward Compatibility Example

**Use case**: Configuration schemas where old systems must tolerate new config options.

**Schema v1.0** (`gts.x.core.db.connection_config.v1.0~`):
```json
{
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.db.connection_config.v1.0~",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["host", "port", "database"],
  "properties": {
    "host": { "type": "string" },
    "port": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 65535 },
    "database": { "type": "string" },
    "timeout": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "default": 30 }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Schema v1.1** (promotes the optional `timeout` property to required):
```json
{
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.db.connection_config.v1.1~",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["host", "port", "database", "timeout"],
  "properties": {
    "host": { "type": "string" },
    "port": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 65535 },
    "database": { "type": "string" },
    "timeout": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 1 }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Compatibility analysis**:
- ✅ **Forward**: v1.0 accepts every v1.1 instance (`timeout` is required by v1.1 and accepted as optional by v1.0)
- ❌ **Backward**: v1.1 consumer **rejects** v1.0 data (missing required `timeout`)
- ❌ **Full**: Not fully compatible

**Deployment strategy**: Update config producers to always include `timeout`, then update consumers to v1.1.

**Config examples**:
```json
// v1.0 config (rejected by v1.1 because timeout is now required)
{"host": "db.example.com", "port": 5432, "database": "mydb"}

// v1.1 config (valid for both schemas)
{"host": "db.example.com", "port": 5432, "database": "mydb", "timeout": 60}
```

#### 4.6.2 Backward Compatibility Example (Closed Model)

**Use case**: Event schemas where producers and consumers can be deployed independently.

**Base event schema v1** (`gts.x.core.events.type.v1~`)
```json
{
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["id", "type", "timestamp"],
  "properties": {
    "id": { "type": "string" },
    "type": { "type": "string" },
    "timestamp": { "type": "integer" },
    "payload": { "type": "object", "additionalProperties": true }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Schema v1.0** (`gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.api.users.create_request.v1.0~`):
```json
{
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.api.users.create_request.v1.0~",
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~" },
    {
      "properties": {
        "payload": {
          "type": "object",
          "required": ["email", "name"],
          "properties": {
            "email": { "type": "string", "format": "email" },
            "name": { "type": "string" }
          },
          "additionalProperties": false
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Schema v1.1** (adds optional field):
```json
{
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.api.users.create_request.v1.1~",
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~" },
    {
      "properties": {
        "payload": {
          "type": "object",
          "required": ["email", "name"],
          "properties": {
            "email": { "type": "string", "format": "email" },
            "name": { "type": "string" },
            "phoneNumber": { "type": "string" }
          },
          "additionalProperties": false
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Compatibility analysis**:
- ❌ **Forward**: v1.0 server **rejects** v1.1 requests (closed model with `additionalProperties: false` rejects unknown `phoneNumber`)
- ✅ **Backward**: v1.1 server can process v1.0 requests (missing `phoneNumber` is optional)
- ❌ **Full**: Not fully compatible

**Deployment strategy**: Update servers to v1.1 first, then gradually update clients.

**Request payload examples**:
```json
// v1.0 request payload (valid for both schemas)
{"email": "user@example.com", "name": "John Doe"}

// v1.1 request payload (rejected by v1.0 server due to additionalProperties: false)
{"email": "user@example.com", "name": "John Doe", "phoneNumber": "+1234567890"}
```

#### 4.6.3 Additive Evolution in an Open Model

**Schema v1.0** (`gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.0~`):
```json
{
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.0~",
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~" },
    {
      "properties": {
        "payload": {
          "type": "object",
          "required": ["orderId", "customerId", "totalAmount"],
          "properties": {
            "orderId": { "type": "string" },
            "customerId": { "type": "string" },
            "totalAmount": { "type": "number" }
          },
          "additionalProperties": true
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Schema v1.1** (adds optional field):
```json
{
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.1~",
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~" },
    {
      "properties": {
        "payload": {
          "type": "object",
          "required": ["orderId", "customerId", "totalAmount"],
          "properties": {
            "orderId": { "type": "string" },
            "customerId": { "type": "string" },
            "totalAmount": { "type": "number" },
            "currency": { "type": "string", "default": "USD" }
          },
          "additionalProperties": true
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Compatibility analysis**:
- ❌ **Backward schema compatibility**: v1.0 permits an instance such as `"currency": 123` because the property is undeclared in its open `payload`; v1.1 rejects that value because `currency` must be a string.
- ✅ **Forward schema compatibility**: every v1.1 payload is accepted by the open v1.0 payload schema.
- ❌ **Full schema compatibility**: the schemas do not accept exactly the same instances.

The change can nevertheless be **operationally compatible in both deployment directions** when v1.0 producers never emit undeclared `currency` values and v1.0 readers safely ignore unknown fields. A registry may certify that stronger producer/tolerant-reader contract separately. The `default` annotation does not itself materialize a missing `currency` property during JSON Schema validation.

**Event payload examples**:
```json
// v1.0 data (valid for both schemas)
{"orderId": "123", "customerId": "456", "totalAmount": 99.99}

// v1.1 data (valid for v1.1, readable by v1.0 due to open model)
{"orderId": "123", "customerId": "456", "totalAmount": 99.99, "currency": "EUR"}

// also valid for v1.0, but invalid for v1.1
{"orderId": "123", "customerId": "456", "totalAmount": 99.99, "currency": 123}
```

> **Identity-field note**: Changing a version-bearing GTS identifier constrained by `const` is not schema-compatible by itself: the `const` values differ, so no instance carrying that property can satisfy both schemas; if the property is required, the schemas have no shared valid instance. OP#9 casting may deliberately rewrite such an identity field before validation. An implementation that treats this transformation as operationally compatible MUST distinguish the cast result from schema compatibility.

```jsonc
{
  "$id": (
      "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.1~"
  ),
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
      {"$ref": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~"},
      {
          "type": "object",
          "required": ["type", "payload"],
          "properties": {
              "type": {
                  "const": (
                      "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.1~"
                  )
              },
          }
      }
  ]
}
```

```jsonc
{
  "$id": (
      "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.2~"
  ),
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
      {"$ref": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~"},
      {
          "type": "object",
          "required": ["type", "payload"],
          "properties": {
              "type": {
                  "const": (
                      "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.2~" // GTS ID changed to v1.2
                  )
              },
          }
      }
  ]
}
```


#### 4.6.4 Type Derivation vs Type Schema Evolution

This example applies the contrast from §4 to one identifier family:

```json
// Base type (every derived type must satisfy Type Derivation Compatibility with it)
"$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~"

// Derived type v1.0 (refines base type)
"$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.0~"

// Derived type v1.1 (minor version of the derived type)
"$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.1~"
```

**Compatibility rules**:
1. `order_placed.v1.0~` must satisfy Type Derivation Compatibility with base `type.v1~` (derivation)
2. `order_placed.v1.1~` must satisfy Type Derivation Compatibility with base `type.v1~` (derivation)
3. `order_placed.v1.1~` compatibility with `order_placed.v1.0~` depends on the changes made (Type Schema evolution—see examples above)

**The two checks are independent.** Suppose the base requires a numeric `amount >= 0` and `order_placed.v1.0~` narrows it to `amount >= 10`:

- If `v1.1~` tightens the constraint to `amount >= 20`, it remains a valid derivation of the base, but an old instance with `"amount": 15` is rejected by it, so backward evolution compatibility does not hold.
- If `v1.1~` relaxes the constraint to `amount >= -5`, it accepts every `v1.0~` instance and is backward compatible with it, but an instance with `"amount": -1` is rejected by the base, so it is not a valid derivation.

Publishing a successive definition of a derived type may therefore require both checks:

```text
Valid(new-derived) ⊆ Valid(base)          // derivation, always
Valid(old-derived) ⊆ Valid(new-derived)   // backward evolution, when selected
```

Neither check implies the other.

See the [examples folder](./examples/events/types/) for complete schema definitions demonstrating these patterns.


### 4.7 Best Practices for GTS Type Schema Evolution

To maximize compatibility and minimize breaking changes between successive definitions of the same GTS type, follow these recommendations:

1. **Decide each object level's content model when the type is first published**: a closed object can gain optional properties in later definitions; an open object can be extended by derived types, as can a partially open object when the derived properties are compatible with its constraints. When a type needs both, consider closing the envelope and declaring explicit open extension containers. See §4.4.1 for the trade-off and the recommended pattern.

2. **Make new properties optional and define absence semantics**: Optional additions avoid rejecting older instances in closed models and avoid requiring old producers to populate the field. Remember that JSON Schema `default` is an annotation; use it only when the application explicitly materializes defaults.

3. **Treat removal and renaming as breaking unless the table says otherwise**: renaming is always breaking, and removal is breaking in a closed model. Removal from an open model is backward compatible but not forward compatible (§4.5), so check the mode you enforce before relying on it. When in doubt, increment MAJOR.

4. **Deprecate instead of removing**: Mark fields as deprecated in documentation. Keep them in the schema for at least one MAJOR version.

5. **Avoid changing field types**: Type changes are almost always breaking. To evolve a type, use union types: `"type": ["string", "number"]`.

6. **Use a GTS Registry**: Centralize GTS Type management and enforce compatibility checks before allowing new versions to be published.


## 5. Typical Use-cases

### 5.1 Practical Benefits for Service and Platform Vendors

Besides being a universal identifier, GTS provides concrete, production-ready capabilities that solve common architectural challenges for platform vendors and service providers integrating multiple third-party services under single control plane:

#### Type Safety and Evolution
- **Automated compatibility checking**: Validate schema changes against backward/forward/full compatibility rules before deployment (defined in section 4.3; section 4.5 lists the typical consequences)
- **Safe schema evolution**: Combine schema compatibility checks with explicit producer and tolerant-reader contracts for additive open-model changes
- **Version casting**: Automatically upcast/downcast data between minor versions (e.g., process v1.2 data with v1.0 consumer)
- **Breaking change detection**: Prevent accidental breaking changes through automated validation in CI/CD pipelines

#### Multi-Vendor Extensibility
- **Plugin architectures**: Allow third-party vendors to extend platform base types while maintaining compatibility guarantees (see section 3.2)
- **Hybrid storage**: Store common fields in indexed columns, vendor-specific extensions in JSONB—no schema migrations needed (see section 3.2 implementation pattern)
- **Vendor isolation**: Use GTS chains to track data provenance and enforce vendors' data boundaries in shared databases
- **Zero-downtime extensions**: Register new derived types without altering existing tables or restarting services

#### Access Control and Security
- **Wildcard-based policies**: Grant object access permissions using patterns like `gts.vendor.package.*` instead of maintaining explicit lists (see section 3.5)
- **Attribute-based filtering**: Combine GTS identifiers with predicates for fine-grained access control (see section 3.3)
- **Chain-aware authorization**: Restrict access to specific vendor extensions while allowing base type access
- **Audit trails**: Log GTS identifiers for complete traceability of data access and schema usage

#### Developer Experience
- **Human-readable identifiers**: Debug issues by reading event types, config schemas, or API payloads directly from logs
- **Self-documenting APIs**: GTS identifiers encode vendor, package, namespace, and version—no external documentation lookup needed
- **GTS Type Registries**: Build centralized catalogs where GTS Types are indexed by GTS Type Identifiers for discovery and validation
- **Deterministic UUIDs**: Generate stable UUID v5 from GTS identifiers for external systems requiring opaque IDs. The UUID5 namespace is ns:URL + 'gts':

```python
import uuid
GTS_NS = uuid.uuid5(uuid.NAMESPACE_URL, "gts")
print(uuid.uuid5(GTS_NS, "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~"))
print(uuid.uuid5(GTS_NS, "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~abc.app._.custom_event.v1.2"))
```


### 5.2 Example: Multi-Vendor Event Management Platform

**Practical Scenario:**

Consider a vendor, `X`, who operates a multi-tenant event management platform. This platform acts as a broker, receiving events from various producers (e.g., third-party applications) and routing them to the correct handlers. According to the platform's specification, every event must contain a `gtsId` field that references a registered event schema. This allows the platform to validate, authorize, and route events of different kinds, such as general-purpose events, audit logs, and custom messages.

Now, imagine a second vendor, `ABC`, develops an application named `APP` that runs on vendor `X`'s platform. When a customer makes an online purchase within `APP`, the application needs to emit a `store.purchase_audit_event` to the event manager.

In this scenario, vendor `X`'s platform must be able to:
1.  **Authorize** the incoming event, ensuring that vendor `ABC` is permitted to emit it.
2.  **Validate** the event's structure against the correct schema.
3.  **Ensure data isolation**, making the event visible only to authorized parties (e.g., vendor `ABC`'s `APP` administrators) and not to other tenants.

Let's define the schemas required to implement this.

First, let's define the base event schema for vendor `X` event manager:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~",
  "title": "Base Event",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "id": { "type": "string", "$comment": "This field serves as the unique identifier for the event instance" },
    "type": { "type": "string", "$comment": "This field serves as the unique identifier for the event schema" },
    "timestamp": { "type": "integer", "$comment": "timestamp in seconds since epoch" },
    "payload": { "type": "object", "additionalProperties": true, "$comment": "Event payload... can be anything" }
  },
  "required": ["id", "type", "timestamp", "payload"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

Now, let's define the audit event schema for vendor `X` event manager:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core.audit.event.v1~",
  "title": "Audit Event, derived from Base Event",
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~" },
    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "payload": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "user_id": { "type": "string", "$comment": "User ID" },
            "user_agent": { "type": "string", "$comment": "User agent" },
            "ip_address": { "type": "string", "$comment": "IP address" },
            "data": { "type": "object", "additionalProperties": true, "$comment": "Audit event custom data... can be anything" }
          },
          "required": ["user_id", "user_agent", "ip_address", "data"],
          "additionalProperties": false
        }
      },
      "required": ["payload"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Then, let's define the schema of specific audit event registered by vendor `ABC` application `APP`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core.audit.event.v1~abc.app.store.purchase_audit_event.v1.2~",
  "title": "Vendor ABC Custom Purchase Audit Event from app APP",
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core.audit.event.v1~" },
    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "payload": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "data": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "purchase_id": { "type": "string" },
                "amount": { "type": "number" },
                "currency": { "type": "string" },
                "price": { "type": "number" }
              },
              "required": ["purchase_id", "amount", "currency", "price"],
              "additionalProperties": false
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "required": ["payload"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Finally, when the producer (the application `APP` of vendor `ABC`) emits the event, it uses the `type` to identify the event schema and provide required payload:

```json
{
  "id": "e81307e5-5ee8-4c0a-8d1f-bd98a65c517e",
  "type": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core.audit.event.v1~abc.app.store.purchase_audit_event.v1.2~",
  "timestamp": 1743466200000000000,
  "payload": {
    "user_id": "9c905ae1-f0f3-4cfb-aa07-5d9a86219abe",
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)",
    "ip_address": "127.0.0.1",
    "data": {
      "purchase_id": "cats_drinking_bowl_42",
      "amount": 2,
      "currency": "USD",
      "price": 19.95
    }
  }
}
```

When the event manager receives the event it processes it as follows:

1. **Schema Resolution**: Parse the `type` to identify the full chain. The event manager can see that this instance conforms to `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~`, `...~x.core.audit.event.v1~`, and finally `...~abc.app.store.purchase_audit_event.v1.2~`.

2. **Validation**: Load the most specific JSON Schema (`...~abc.app.store.purchase_audit_event.v1.2~`) and validate the event object against it. It would automatically mean the event body is validated against any other schema in the chain (e.g., the base event and the base audit event).

3. **Authorization**: Check if the producer is authorized to emit events matching the pattern `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core.audit.event.v1~abc.app.*` or a broader pattern like `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core.audit.event.v1~abc.*`.

4. **Routing & Auditing**: Use the chain to route events to appropriate handlers or storage if needed.

> **Note**: use the [GTS Kit](https://github.com/globaltypesystem/gts-kit) for visualization of the entities relationship and validation

### 5.3 GTS Registry Requirement

> **Critical implementation requirement:** The architectural guarantees of GTS—particularly type safety across inheritance chains and safe minor version evolution—depend entirely on a stateful **GTS Registry** component. Production systems MUST implement or integrate a registry capable of:
>
> 1. **Storing and indexing** all registered GTS Type Schemas by their GTS Type Identifiers
> 2. **Validating compatibility** of each successive schema definition against its preceding definition before publication — including a new revision published under an unchanged identifier, where §4.2 permits that — against the normative definition in section 4.3 (section 4.5 lists the typical consequences of that definition)
> 3. **Enforcing inheritance constraints** to ensure derived types remain compatible with their base types
> 4. **Rejecting incompatible changes** that violate the declared compatibility mode (backward/forward/full)
> 5. **Providing GTS Type resolution** for validation, casting, and relationship resolution operations
>
> Without a registry performing rigorous type compatibility validation (including schema diffing where applicable), the type safety guarantees of GTS cannot be maintained. Implementations should treat the registry as a critical infrastructure component, similar to a database or message broker.


## 6. Implementation-defined and Non-goals

This specification intentionally does not enforce lifecycle, operational or governance choices. It is up to the implementation vendor to define policies and behavior for:

1. Whether a defined type is exported (published) and available for cross-vendor use via APIs or an event bus.
2. Whether a given JSON/JSON Schema definition is mutable or immutable (e.g., handling an incompatible change without changing the minor or major version).
3. How to implement access policies and access checks based on the GTS query and attribute access languages.
4. When to introduce a new minor version versus a new major version.
5. GTS identifiers renaming and aliasing
6. Which Type Schema Evolution Compatibility mode or modes (backward, forward, full) a registry enforces for each type identity or namespace, and its publication policy for successive definitions. The modes themselves are defined normatively in §4.3.
7. Migration of objects between type versions, including transformation, validation, and rollout strategies.

> **Non-goals reminder**: GTS is not an eventing framework, transport, or workflow. It standardizes identifiers and basic validation/casting semantics around JSON and JSON Schema.


## 7. Comparison with other identifiers

- JSONSchema $schema url: While JSONSchema provides a robust framework for defining the structure of JSON data, GTS extends this by offering clear vendor, package and namespace notation and chaining making it easier to track and validate data instances across different systems and versions.
- UUID: Opaque and globally unique. GTS is meaningful to humans and machines; UUIDs can be derived from GTS deterministically when opaque IDs are required.
- Apple UTI: Human-readable, reverse-DNS-like. GTS is similar in readability but adds explicit versioning, vendors/apps support, chaining, and schema/instance distinction suitable for JSON Schema-based validation.
- Amazon ARN: Global and structured, but cloud-service-specific. GTS is vendor-neutral and domain-agnostic, focused on data schemas and instances.


## 8. Parsing and Validation

### 8.1 Single-segment regex (type or instance)

Single-chain variant:

```regex
^gts\.([a-z_][a-z0-9_]*)\.([a-z_][a-z0-9_]*)\.([a-z_][a-z0-9_]*)\.([a-z_][a-z0-9_]*)\.v(0|[1-9]\d*)(?:\.(0|[1-9]\d*))?~?$
```

Verbose, named groups (Python `re.VERBOSE`):

```regex
^\s*
gts\.
(?P<vendor>[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*)\.
(?P<package>[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*)\.
(?P<namespace>[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*)\.
(?P<type>[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*)
\.v(?P<major>0|[1-9]\d*)
(?:\.(?P<minor>0|[1-9]\d*))?
(?P<is_type>~)?
\s*$
```

`is_type` captures the optional trailing `~` (present for type IDs, absent for instance IDs).

### 8.2 Chained identifier regex
 
 For chained identifiers, the pattern enforces that all segments except the final instance designator are type IDs (with `~` separators):
 
 ```regex
 ^\s*gts\.[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*\.[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*\.[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*\.[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*\.v(0|[1-9]\d*)(?:\.(0|[1-9]\d*))?(?:~[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*\.[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*\.[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*\.[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*\.v(0|[1-9]\d*)(?:\.(0|[1-9]\d*))?)*(?:~(?:[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12})?)?\s*$
 ```

 **Pattern explanation:**
 - Starts with a single absolute segment (`gts.` prefix)
 - Followed by zero or more relative segments, each prefixed by `~`
 - The identifier may end with:
   - `~` (type)
   - a segment end (instance)
   - `~<uuid>` (combined anonymous instance)

 **Validation rules:**
 1. Standalone type identifier: MUST end with `~`
 2. In a chain, all elements before the final instance designator MUST be types (end with `~` in the original string).
    - For well-known instances, the final designator is the last `<vendor>.<package>.<namespace>.<type>.v...` segment (no trailing `~`).
    - For combined anonymous instances, the final designator is the UUID tail after the last `~`.
 3. Only the first segment uses the `gts.` prefix; chained segments are relative (no `gts.`)

 **Parsing strategy:**
 - Split on `~` to get raw segments; the first is absolute, the rest are relative
 - If the final raw segment is a UUID, treat it as the combined-anonymous instance tail; otherwise treat the final raw segment as the well-known instance segment (or absent, if the identifier ends with `~`)
 - Parse the non-UUID segments as GTS segments (first absolute, the rest relative)
 - Validate that all segments except the final instance designator are types


## 9. Reference Implementation Recommendations

GTS specification provides recommendations for reference implementation of the core operations for working with GTS identifiers. These recommendations are not mandatory but are provided to help implementers understand the expected behavior of appropriate reference implementations in different programming languages.

For existing reference implementations, refer to the official libraries:

- [gts-python](https://www.github.com/GlobalTypeSystem/gts-python)
- [gts-go](https://www.github.com/GlobalTypeSystem/gts-go)
- [gts-rust](https://www.github.com/GlobalTypeSystem/gts-rust)

### 9.1 - Identifier reference in JSON and JSON Schema

This section provides **recommended** conventions for embedding GTS identifiers into JSON objects (instances) and JSON Schemas (types). Implementations may support additional conventions, but these provide an interoperable default.

**JSON Schema (`$id`)**

It is recommended to put the GTS **type identifier** into the JSON Schema `$id` field, using a URI-like form by prepending the `gts://` prefix:

> **Reserved prefix note**: Do **not** place the canonical `gts.` string directly in `$id`. Always wrap the identifier with the `gts://` scheme (for example: `"$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~"`). The raw `gts.` prefix is reserved for canonical identifiers inside the scheme, and mixing it directly into `$id` leads to ambiguity and upload failures.

```json
{
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Event Envelope (Common Fields)"
}
```

Implementation note: GTS itself defines the canonical identifier string starting with `gts.`. When `$id` is expressed as `gts://...`, implementations should trim the `gts://` prefix and treat the remainder as the canonical GTS identifier for validation, comparison, and registry keys. The `gts://` prefix exists only to make `$id` URI-compatible.

When `$id` starts with `gts://`, the remainder **must** be a valid, wildcard-free GTS identifier (see OP#1 rules). Asterisks and other wildcard tokens are not permitted in GTS Type Identifiers.

**JSON Schema (`$ref`)**

It is recommended to make GTS Type references in JSON Schema `$ref` URI-compatible the same way as `$id`, by prepending the `gts://` prefix when `$ref` points at a GTS Type Identifier:

> **Note:** Just like `$id`, do not embed raw `gts.` prefixes in `$ref`. Use the URI form (`gts://...`) and ensure the referenced identifier is a valid GTS ID with no wildcard characters.

```json
{
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~" }
  ]
}
```

Note: local JSON Pointer references (e.g. `"$ref": "#/definitions/Foo"` under Draft-07, or `"$ref": "#/$defs/Foo"` under Draft 2019-09+) remain valid. The `gts://` recommendation applies only when `$ref` targets a GTS Type Identifier. The canonical container for reusable subschemas follows the dialect declared by `$schema`: `definitions` for Draft-07, `$defs` for Draft 2019-09 and later; both are admissible in GTS Type Schemas.

Implementation note: When `$ref` is expressed as `gts://...`, implementations should trim the `gts://` prefix and treat the remainder as the canonical GTS identifier for resolution, validation, comparison, and registry keys. The `gts://` prefix exists only to make `$ref` URI-compatible.

The post-`gts://` content must therefore parse as a valid GTS identifier with no wildcards; otherwise the schema upload should be rejected.

**JSON instances (well-known vs anonymous)**

- **Well-known instances (named)**: recommended to use a GTS identifier in the `id` field (alternatives: `gtsId`, `gts_id`). Prefer a chained identifier so the **left segment(s)** define the GTS Type automatically, and the **rightmost** segment is the instance name.
  - Example (well-known topic/stream instance): `gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~x.commerce._.orders.v1.0`
- **Anonymous instances**: typically use the `id` field to store the object UUID, and store the GTS Type Identifier separately in a `type` field (alternatives: `gtsType`, `gts_type`).
  - Example (anonymous event instance): `id: "7a1d2f34-5678-49ab-9012-abcdef123456"`, `type: "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.0~"`

See working examples under `./examples/events`:
- Well-known topics: `./examples/events/instances/gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~x.commerce.orders.orders.v1.0.json`
- Anonymous events: `./examples/events/instances/gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1~.examples.json`

### 9.2 - GTS operations (OP#1 - OP#13):

Implement and expose all operations OP#1–OP#13 listed above and add appropriate unit tests.

- **OP#1 - ID Validation**: Verify identifier syntax
- **OP#2 - ID Extraction**: Extract identifiers from JSON objects or JSON Schema documents
- **OP#3 - ID Parsing**: Decompose identifiers into constituent parts (vendor, package, namespace, type, version, etc.)
- **OP#4 - ID Pattern Matching**: Match identifiers against patterns containing wildcards
- **OP#5 - ID to UUID Mapping**: Generate deterministic UUIDs from GTS identifiers
- **OP#6 - Schema Validation**: Validate object instances against their corresponding schemas. When validating instances, if the rightmost type in the chain is marked `x-gts-abstract: true`, validation MUST fail (see section 9.11)
- **OP#7 - Relationship Resolution**: Load schemas and instances, resolve inter-dependencies, and detect broken references
- **OP#8 - Type Schema Evolution Compatibility Checking**: Compare two definitions of one type identity, addressed by their distinct GTS Type Identifiers, and report a Compatibility Verdict (`compatible`, `incompatible`, or `unknown`) for the backward, forward, and full relations. `unknown` means the checker could not establish either compatibility or incompatibility; it is not itself evidence of incompatibility. The checker reports evidence, while registry publication policy decides how the verdicts affect admission.
- **OP#9 - Version Casting**: Transform instances between compatible MINOR versions
- **OP#10 - Query Execution**: Filter identifier collections using the GTS query language
- **OP#11 - Attribute Access**: Retrieve property values and metadata using the attribute selector (`@`)
- **OP#12 - Type Derivation Validation**: Validate that a derived type correctly extends its base chain. Today this includes JSON Schema-level constraint compatibility (every derived schema MUST conform to all constraints defined in its parent schemas throughout the inheritance hierarchy — `additionalProperties`, narrowing/widening, etc. — regardless of whether the derived schema references the parent via `allOf` + `$ref` or re-declares parent fields directly) and trait inheritance from OP#13. This ensures type safety in extension and prevents constraint violations in multi-level type hierarchies. When validating derived types, if any base in the chain is marked `x-gts-final: true`, validation MUST fail (see section 9.11)
- **OP#13 - Schema Traits Validation**: Validate schema traits (`x-gts-traits-schema` / `x-gts-traits`). See section 9.7 for full semantics and validation rules.

### 9.3 - GTS entities registration

Implement simple GTS instances in-memory registry with optional GTS entities validation on registration. If "validation" parameter enabled, the entity registration action must ensure that all the GTS references are valid - identitfiers must match GTS pattern, refererred entities must be registered, the GTS reference keywords `x-gts-type-ref` / `x-gts-instance-ref` must be valid (see §9.6). Referent existence is this registration policy; the keywords themselves match syntactically and need no registry (§9.6.6)

### 9.4 - CLI support

Provide a CLI wrapping OPs for local use and CI: e.g., `gts validate`, `gts parse`, `gts match`, `gts uuid`, `gts compat`, `gts cast`, `gts query`, `gts get`. Use non-zero exit codes on validation/compatibility failures for pipeline integration.

### 9.5 - Web server with OpenAPI

Implement an HTTP server that conforms to `tests/openapi.json` so it can be tested from this specification directory.

```
# 1. Start appropriate server, normally as 'gts server'
# 2. Test it's conformance to required openapi.json by running specification tests:
pytest ./tests
```

### 9.6 - GTS Reference Keywords (`x-gts-type-ref` / `x-gts-instance-ref`)

A **GTS reference keyword** asserts that a JSON string value is a GTS identifier of a specific **kind**, rooted at a specific GTS Type. A **GTS Type Identifier** ends with `~`, a **GTS Instance Identifier** does not (§2.1); there is one keyword per kind.

This section is self-contained and normative for reference matching. It reuses the wildcard *syntax* of §10 but defines its own matching semantics.

#### 9.6.1 Keywords

| Keyword | JSON type | Asserts the value is | Typical use |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| **`x-gts-type-ref`** | `string` (operand) | a **GTS Type Identifier** rooted at the operand | `type` / `gtsType` discriminators, fields naming a type to resolve |
| **`x-gts-instance-ref`** | `string` (operand) | a **GTS Instance Identifier** rooted at the operand | enum-like state fields, `topicRef`-style association links, capability and requirement lists, `id` of a well-known instance |

- **Assertions.** Both keywords are assertions: they are evaluated at the schema location where they appear and produce a boolean result there, composing through the applicators of the dialect declared by `$schema` (`allOf`, `anyOf`, `oneOf`, `not`, `if`/`then`/`else`, `$ref`, `items`, `properties`, …). An implementation MUST NOT enforce every textual occurrence in a document — an occurrence in a branch the dialect does not evaluate for a given instance location contributes nothing.
- **Placement.** Unlike the four document-level keywords of §9.7 and §9.11, these are **field-level** and MAY appear at any schema location (§11.0).
- **Non-string values.** The assertion means "a string containing a matching GTS identifier", so a value that is not a JSON string **fails** it. A sibling `"type": "string"` is good practice but is not required.
- **Mutual exclusion.** A single schema location MUST NOT carry both keywords: no candidate satisfies both, so the combination MUST be rejected as an invalid schema. To accept either kind, use `anyOf` (§9.6.5).
- **Instance documents.** Both keywords have GTS meaning only in JSON Schema documents (documents with `$schema`). Elsewhere, fields with these names are ordinary data.

```json
{
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.infra.compute.vm.v1~",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "type":       { "type": "string", "x-gts-type-ref": "/$id" },
    "powerState": { "type": "string", "x-gts-instance-ref": "gts.x.infra.compute.vm_state.v1~" }
  }
}
```

`type` holds a Type Identifier such as `gts.x.infra.compute.vm.v1~vmware.esxi._.vm.v1~`; `powerState` holds an Instance Identifier such as `gts.x.infra.compute.vm_state.v1~x.infra._.running.v1`.

#### 9.6.2 Operands

The keyword value is an **operand** denoting the GTS Type root (or set of type roots) the reference is rooted at. Exactly three forms exist, distinguished by this **parsing precedence**:

| # | Form | Recognized when the value | Resolves to |
|---|------|---------------------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Reserved dynamic token** | is exactly `/$id` | the `$id` of the **leaf GTS Type Schema selected for the validation operation**, with the `gts://` prefix removed (§9.6.4) |
| 2 | **JSON Pointer** | begins with `/` but is not exactly `/$id` | the JSON **string value** found at that pointer |
| 3 | **Literal** | begins with `gts.` | itself, optionally containing a wildcard (§9.6.3) |

Any other value is an invalid operand. `/$id/foo` is an ordinary form-2 pointer, not malformed reserved syntax.

**Form 2** resolves per [RFC 6901](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901) against the root of the **schema resource in which the keyword was authored**. Resource boundaries follow the dialect declared by `$schema`, including embedded resources established by a nested `$id`; the resource is not necessarily the physical file. Pointer resolution is therefore **lexical and static** — it never depends on which leaf type is being validated. Form 1 is the only dynamic form; to root a constraint statically at the authoring type, write the literal.

The pointer MUST resolve to a JSON **string**. That string, with any `gts://` prefix removed, **is** the operand, and it is **terminal**: it MUST itself be a literal GTS type root or wildcard pattern (form 3), and it is **not** reinterpreted as a pointer or as the reserved token. A pointer that resolves to the string `/properties/b`, to a non-string, or to nothing at all is an invalid operand.

```json
{
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.testref._.pointer.v1~",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "properties": {
    "some": { "type": "string", "const": "gts.x.testref._.target.v1~" },
    "id":   { "type": "string", "x-gts-instance-ref": "/properties/some/const" }
  }
}
```

**Resolved operand.** However it is obtained, the resolved operand MUST be able to denote at least one GTS Type Identifier: a **wildcard-free** operand MUST itself be a canonical GTS Type Identifier, and a **wildcard** operand is valid when its matched set can contain a Type Identifier. A pattern such as `gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~x.core._.default.v*` is therefore valid — it denotes the Type Identifiers it matches, and the non-Type strings it also matches are irrelevant. An operand that resolves to an Instance Identifier, to a pattern whose Type-Identifier subset is necessarily empty, or to a value that is not a valid GTS identifier or pattern makes the schema invalid (§9.6.6).

#### 9.6.3 Matching

A candidate value is validated in two stages.

**Stage 1 — rooted match.** The candidate MUST be a syntactically valid GTS identifier under the **chained** grammar — §2.1 and the EBNF of §2.3 govern — whose parsed type chain begins with the resolved operand.

- A **literal** operand denotes one canonical GTS Type Identifier; the candidate matches when its parsed type chain begins with that identifier **at a chain boundary**.
- A **wildcard** operand denotes the **subset of canonical GTS Type Identifiers** it matches; the candidate matches when its type chain begins with at least one member. Implementations need not enumerate the subset — comparing the candidate's type-chain prefix against the pattern is sufficient. A trailing chain wildcard on a type root (`gts.a.b._.c.v1~*`) is valid but redundant: rooted matching already admits descendants.
- Matching MUST operate on the parsed chain, never on raw lexical `startsWith`.

**MINOR versions.** An operand segment carrying no MINOR is rooted at any MINOR of that MAJOR; an operand carrying a MINOR is rooted at that MINOR only:

| Operand | Candidate rooted at | Matches |
|---|---|---|
| `gts.a.b._.c.v1~` | `gts.a.b._.c.v1~` | ✅ |
| `gts.a.b._.c.v1~` | `gts.a.b._.c.v1.0~`, `gts.a.b._.c.v1.1~` | ✅ |
| `gts.a.b._.c.v1.0~` | `gts.a.b._.c.v1.0~` | ✅ |
| `gts.a.b._.c.v1.0~` | `gts.a.b._.c.v1.1~` | ❌ |
| `gts.a.b._.c.v1~` | `gts.a.b._.c.v2.0~` | ❌ |

This is a **matching** relation only. It does not make `gts.a.b._.c.v1~` and `gts.a.b._.c.v1.1~` the same registered type identity; §4.2 governs that and is unaffected.

**Stage 2 — kind check.** The candidate's kind MUST equal the kind the keyword selects, read off the parsed canonical identifier: a Type Identifier ends with `~`, an Instance Identifier does not. No registry lookup is involved.

For a resolved operand `gts.a.b._.c.v1~`:

| Candidate | `x-gts-type-ref` | `x-gts-instance-ref` |
|---|---|---|
| `gts.a.b._.c.v1~` — the operand type itself | accepted | rejected |
| `gts.a.b._.c.v1~d.e._.f.v1~` — a derived type | accepted | rejected |
| `gts.a.b._.c.v1~x.y._.z.v1` — a well-known instance | rejected | accepted |
| `gts.a.b._.c.v1~d.e._.f.v1~x.y._.z.v1` — an instance of a derived type | rejected | accepted |
| `gts.a.b._.c.v1~7a1d2f34-5678-49ab-9012-abcdef123456` — a combined anonymous instance (§3.7) | rejected | accepted |
| `gts.a.b._.c.v1~d.e._.f.v1~7a1d2f34-5678-49ab-9012-abcdef123456` — a combined anonymous instance of a derived type | rejected | accepted |
| `gts.other.b._.c.v1~` — a Type Identifier not rooted at the operand | rejected | rejected |
| `gts.other.b._.c.v1~x.y._.z.v1` — an Instance Identifier not rooted at the operand | rejected | rejected |
| `gts.a.b._.c.v1` — unchained, no trailing `~` | rejected | rejected |

The last row follows from §2.1 and §2.3: every Instance Identifier carries a left-hand type segment, and the EBNF admits only the three chain suffixes, all of which require at least one `~`. An unchained non-`~` identifier is therefore not a GTS identifier at all.

With the wildcard operand `gts.*`, `x-gts-type-ref` accepts any valid GTS Type Identifier and `x-gts-instance-ref` any valid chained GTS Instance Identifier.

#### 9.6.4 The reserved `/$id` operand

`/$id` resolves to the `$id` of the **leaf GTS Type Schema selected for the validation operation** — the type an instance is being validated against, or the type schema being registered or validated — with the `gts://` prefix removed. It is a single string lookup on one identified schema; it traverses nothing.

A constraint reached through an explicitly authored `$ref`/`allOf` therefore **rebinds dynamically** to the leaf type:

```text
base   gts.a.b._.c.v1~            declares:  x-gts-instance-ref: "/$id"
leaf   gts.a.b._.c.v1~d.e._.f.v1~     body:  allOf [ $ref gts://gts.a.b._.c.v1~, … ]

validating an instance against the leaf:
  accepted:   gts.a.b._.c.v1~d.e._.f.v1~x.y._.z.v1
  accepted:   gts.a.b._.c.v1~d.e._.f.v1~g.h._.i.v1~x.y._.z.v1
  rejected:   gts.a.b._.c.v1~d.e._.q.v1~x.y._.z.v1     (sibling branch)
```

This is what the `id` / `type` self-reference pattern needs: the base declares once that the field holds an instance of *itself*, and each leaf automatically tightens that to *this leaf*. A field that must instead stay rooted at the base uses the literal operand `x-gts-instance-ref: "gts.a.b._.c.v1~"`. Choose deliberately: a field listing *other* entities of the same family (module requirements, cross-references) wants the literal, not `/$id`.

**Reachability.** A reference keyword is evaluated only where the dialect evaluates its schema location. The chained `$id` establishes derivation and OP#12 compatibility but does **not** by itself import ancestor schema bodies (see [`adr/0001-derivation-form.md`](adr/0001-derivation-form.md)): a derived Type Schema that neither `$ref`s nor restates its base inherits no reference constraint from it, and there is nothing to rebind.

#### 9.6.5 Accepting either kind, and exact matches

Both keywords are **rooted**, not exact. A field that must hold one specific identifier combines the keyword with standard JSON Schema `const`:

```json
{ "type": "string", "x-gts-type-ref": "gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~", "const": "gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~x.core._.default.v1~" }
```

A field that deliberately accepts **either** kind uses standard JSON Schema `anyOf`, one branch per keyword:

```json
{
  "anyOf": [
    { "type": "string", "x-gts-type-ref":     "gts.x.infra.compute.vm_state.v1~" },
    { "type": "string", "x-gts-instance-ref": "gts.x.infra.compute.vm_state.v1~" }
  ]
}
```

Because the keywords are assertions (§9.6.1), only the branch outcomes matter: `anyOf` succeeds when at least one branch asserts successfully. An implementation that scanned for keyword occurrences instead of evaluating branches would reject every value here.

#### 9.6.6 Enforcement

Enforcement follows the pattern of the other `x-gts-*` keywords (§9.11.5): checks run when validation is enabled on registration, and always on the explicit validation endpoints.

**Schema-level** (`/validate-type-schema`; Type Schema registration with validation enabled). The following make the Type Schema invalid and MUST be rejected (fail fast):

- a keyword value that is not a string, or that matches none of the three operand forms (§9.6.2);
- a form-2 pointer that does not resolve, resolves to a non-string, or resolves to a string that is not a literal type root or wildcard pattern;
- a resolved operand that is an Instance Identifier, a pattern whose Type-Identifier subset is necessarily empty, or not a valid GTS identifier or pattern;
- both reference keywords at the same schema location (§9.6.1).

**Instance-level** (`/validate-instance`, `/validate-entity`; instance registration with validation enabled). Each evaluated occurrence asserts per §9.6.3.

Both stages of §9.6.3 are syntactic and require no registry. Whether the referenced entity must also **exist** is registration policy (§9.3); an implementation MAY resolve candidates against a GTS Registry as an additional check, and MUST report a missing referent distinctly from a kind or rooting failure.

Where a Type Schema registered without validation carries an invalid operand, an operation that later evaluates that keyword MUST fail with a **schema-level** error identifying the offending Type Schema and keyword location — not as an instance validation failure, and not as a server error.

See `./examples/modules` and `./examples/typespec/vms` for typical patterns.


### 9.7 - GTS Type Schema Traits (`x-gts-traits-schema` / `x-gts-traits`)

**OP#13 - Schema Traits Validation**: Validate that `x-gts-traits` values in derived schemas conform to the `x-gts-traits-schema` defined in their base schemas. Verify that, for non-abstract types, all required trait properties in the effective trait-schema are resolved (via explicit value in the chain-merged `x-gts-traits` or via `default` in the effective trait-schema), and that the chain-merged trait values satisfy the effective trait-schema's other constraints (including `const`, which a publisher uses to lock individual trait values across descendants — see §9.7.5). Both `x-gts-traits-schema` and `x-gts-traits` are GTS Type Schema annotation keywords. `x-gts-traits-schema` MUST be a valid JSON Schema [subschema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#subschema) (object, `true`, or `false`). Uses the same validation endpoints (`/validate-type-schema`, `/validate-entity`).

A **schema trait** is a semantic annotation attached to a GTS Type Schema that describes **system behaviour** for processing instances of that type. Traits are not part of the object data model — they do not define instance properties. Instead, they configure cross-cutting concerns such as:

- **Retention rules** — how long instances of this type are kept (e.g., object TTL)
- **Processing directives** — how attributes should be handled (e.g., PII masking, indexing hints)
- **Association links** — linking schemas to related entities (e.g., associating an event type with its topic/stream)

#### 9.7.1 Keywords

Two JSON Schema annotation keywords are used together:

| Keyword | JSON type | Purpose | Typical location |
|---------|-----------|---------|------------------|
| **`x-gts-traits-schema`** | JSON Schema (object \| boolean) | Defines the **shape** of the trait — property names, types, constraints, and `default` values | Base / ancestor schemas |
| **`x-gts-traits`** | Plain JSON object | Provides concrete **values** for the trait properties | Derived (leaf) schemas; may also appear alongside `x-gts-traits-schema` in the same schema |

**Schema annotation keywords:** Both `x-gts-traits-schema` and `x-gts-traits` have GTS meaning only in JSON Schema documents (documents with `$schema`). In instance documents, fields with these names are ordinary data and have no GTS trait semantics unless the instance's own JSON Schema assigns constraints to them.

**Keyword placement:** Both `x-gts-traits-schema` and `x-gts-traits` are type-level keywords and MUST appear at the **top level** of the GTS Type Schema document, adjacent to `$id` and `$schema` — NOT nested inside an `allOf` entry or any other subschema. A misplaced occurrence MUST be rejected (fail fast). This governs only the position of the keyword itself, not the contents of `x-gts-traits-schema` (which is an ordinary JSON Schema subschema and may freely use `$ref`, `allOf`, etc.). The same rule applies to the modifiers `x-gts-final` / `x-gts-abstract` (§9.11).

A single schema MAY contain both keywords. This is explicitly allowed and useful when a mid-level schema defines new trait properties (`x-gts-traits-schema`) while also resolving traits inherited from its parent (`x-gts-traits`).

**`x-gts-traits-schema`** is a JSON Schema [subschema](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#subschema). By the JSON Schema definition, its value MAY therefore be:

- an **object subschema** — declares the trait shape in the usual way (`properties`, `required`, etc.);
- **`true`** — admits any trait values (the trivially-satisfied schema; traits remain permitted but unconstrained at this layer);
- **`false`** — prohibits traits entirely on this host, and on any descendant whose chain includes this layer (`false` is unsatisfiable, so the chain-aggregated effective trait-schema becomes unsatisfiable and `x-gts-traits` is rejected).

When `x-gts-traits-schema` is an object subschema, the **effective** trait-schema (after chain aggregation per §9.7.5) MUST constrain trait values to JSON objects.

Because `x-gts-traits-schema` is an ordinary JSON Schema subschema, all standard JSON Schema constructs apply inside it with their normal semantics; implementations MUST NOT invent a custom reference mechanism for `$ref`.

The trait shape MAY be declared **inline**, **referenced** from a standalone trait-schema registered as an ordinary GTS Type via `$ref`, or **composed** via `allOf` of inline parts and references. The choice is an authoring decision — inline keeps the trait surface private to the host and inheriting the host's ACL; the `$ref`-to-registered-type form is appropriate when the trait surface should be a separately governed artifact.

**Inheritance along the host-type derivation chain happens at the registry level, not at the author level.** A descendant host type does NOT need to repeat the ancestor's `x-gts-traits-schema` inside its own — the registry composes all `x-gts-traits-schema` declarations encountered along the host's `$id` chain via JSON Schema `allOf` (see §9.7.5). A descendant MAY write an explicit `allOf` that includes a `$ref` to an ancestor's `x-gts-traits-schema`; doing so is redundant under chain aggregation but not invalid (consistent with the JSON Schema extension framing — see [`adr/0001-derivation-form.md`](adr/0001-derivation-form.md)).

See [`adr/0002-x-gts-traits-schema.md`](adr/0002-x-gts-traits-schema.md) for the rationale behind the subschema framing and the chain-aggregation rule.

**`x-gts-traits`** is a plain JSON object of concrete values. Constraint keywords like `const` belong in `x-gts-traits-schema` (the trait schema), not in `x-gts-traits` (the trait values).

#### 9.7.2 Trait schema definition (`x-gts-traits-schema`)

A type schema declares the trait shape — property names, types, constraints, and `default` values. Any type in the `$id` chain (base or descendant) MAY contribute its own `x-gts-traits-schema`; the registry composes all such declarations along the chain via JSON Schema `allOf` into a single effective trait-schema (see §9.7.5).

The same derivation compatibility principle that governs host body schemas (§3.1) applies to `x-gts-traits-schema`: every value valid against the descendant's effective trait-schema MUST also be valid against each ancestor's trait-schema. This is enforced naturally by the `allOf` composition — contradictions across the chain (e.g., conflicting types, narrowed constraints that don't overlap) produce an unsatisfiable effective trait-schema and fail registration. Typically a base declares the initial trait shape and descendants **narrow** existing trait properties (tighten constraints, `const`, narrower enums). Descendants MAY also **extend** the trait surface by introducing new top-level properties — but only if no ancestor's `x-gts-traits-schema` declares `additionalProperties: false` (or another restriction that would reject the new property); otherwise the new property is treated as "additional" against that ancestor's branch in the `allOf` composition and validation fails, by the same mechanic as §3.1 governs for host bodies. `default` values are JSON Schema annotations and do not participate in narrowing: descendants MAY freely redeclare a property's `default` in their own `x-gts-traits-schema`. A publisher who wants a trait value to be fixed across descendants SHOULD declare `"const": <value>` (a real narrowing of the validation surface), not rely on a default.

**Inline definition:**

```json
{
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "x-gts-traits-schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "topicRef": {
        "description": "GTS ID of the topic/stream where events of this type are published.",
        "type": "string",
        "x-gts-instance-ref": "gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~",
        "default": "gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~x.core._.default.v1"
      },
      "retention": {
        "description": "ISO 8601 duration for event retention.",
        "type": "string",
        "default": "P30D"
      }
    }
  },
  "properties": { "..." : {} }
}
```

**`$ref` to reusable trait schemas:**

A platform MAY publish standalone, reusable trait schemas (e.g., `RetentionTrait`, `TopicTrait`, `PIITrait`). Base schemas reference them via standard `$ref`:

```json
{
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "x-gts-traits-schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "allOf": [
      { "$ref": "gts://gts.x.core.traits.retention.v1~" },
      { "$ref": "gts://gts.x.core.traits.topic.v1~" }
    ]
  },
  "properties": { "..." : {} }
}
```

Where each referenced trait schema is a standalone JSON Schema registered as a GTS entity:

```json
{
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.traits.retention.v1~",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "retention": {
      "description": "ISO 8601 duration for data retention.",
      "type": "string",
      "default": "P30D"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 9.7.3 Trait values in derived schemas (`x-gts-traits`)

Derived schemas **resolve** (configure) trait values by providing a plain JSON object via `x-gts-traits`. Trait values MUST be valid against the effective trait schema derived from the inheritance chain as defined below.

`x-gts-traits` is a top-level member of the document (§9.7.1), a sibling of `$id` / `$schema` / `allOf` — not nested inside an `allOf` entry:

```json
{
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.0~",
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~" }
  ],
  "x-gts-traits": {
    "topicRef": "gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~x.commerce._.orders.v1",
    "retention": "P90D"
  }
}
```

#### 9.7.4 Both keywords in the same schema

A mid-level schema MAY extend the trait schema while also providing values for inherited traits:

Both keywords sit at the top level alongside `$id` (§9.7.1); the `allOf` carries only the body composition:

```json
{
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core.audit.event.v1~",
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~" }
  ],
  "x-gts-traits-schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "auditRetention": {
        "description": "Retention override for audit compliance.",
        "type": "string",
        "default": "P365D"
      }
    }
  },
  "x-gts-traits": {
    "topicRef": "gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~x.core._.audit.v1"
  }
}
```

#### 9.7.5 Trait merge and validation semantics (normative)

Traits MUST follow standard JSON Schema practices. The key rule is that **the registry MUST treat trait schemas as normal JSON Schemas** and MUST rely on standard JSON Schema composition and `$ref` semantics (especially `allOf`) rather than inventing a bespoke merge algorithm.

Given an inheritance chain `S₀ → S₁ → … → Sₙ`:

- **Trait schema merge**
  - The registry MUST build an *effective trait schema* by composing all `x-gts-traits-schema` values along the **`$id` chain** using JSON Schema `allOf`. Aggregation follows `$id` regardless of how the host body expresses derivation — including bodies with no `allOf` (ADR-0001 Variant 2c).
  - Any `$ref` inside `x-gts-traits-schema` MUST be resolved by standard JSON Schema rules (base URI + JSON Pointer fragments). A fragment ref (e.g. `#/$defs/Foo`) resolves against the host type schema the keyword appears in, not against the extracted trait subschema in isolation.
  - Derived schemas MAY further constrain (narrow) traits by adding constraints in their `x-gts-traits-schema` (naturally enforced by `allOf`).

- **Trait value merge**
  - The registry MUST build an *effective traits object* by walking the type's `$id` chain root → leaf and applying each layer's `x-gts-traits` as a [JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7396)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7396) against the chain-merged object so far. Top-level scalar / array / `null` leaves are overwritten by the descendant (last-wins). Object-valued top-level traits merge **recursively** — fields of an ancestor's object trait that the descendant does not restate are preserved.
  - **Arrays replace wholesale** at any depth (per RFC 7396). Authors who need item-level composability SHOULD model the data as a keyed object instead of an array.
  - **`null` at any depth deletes that key** from the effective object (per RFC 7396). The principal use case is to revert an ancestor-set value and let the trait-schema's `default` re-apply via the materialization step described in the Completeness check below — that is, a descendant writes `"<key>": null` to "fall back to the schema default" without picking a specific value. If the deleted key is `required` and has no `default`, the completeness check (OP#13) fails for non-abstract types (the descendant must then either mark itself abstract or accept that "delete + required + no default" is an unresolvable contract). Authors who want `null` as an *intended* trait value cannot express it via this merge and must use a sentinel value documented as part of the trait shape.
  - Defaults declared in the effective trait-schema MUST be materialized into the effective traits object before the Completeness check runs (per ADR-0003): for every property declared in the effective trait-schema with a `default` and not present in the chain-merged object, the registry MUST substitute the default value. The Completeness check below (OP#13) operates on the resulting *materialized* effective traits object.
  - A publisher who wants a trait value to be **locked** across all descendants of a base type SHOULD declare `"const": <value>` for that property in `x-gts-traits-schema`. A descendant attempting to override the value will fail the standard JSON Schema validation that runs against the effective trait-schema (per the Completeness check below). No GTS-specific "immutability" rule is required — `const` is the mechanism.
  - `const` constrains the **value** of a property, not its presence: per standard JSON Schema it asserts nothing when the property is absent. A publisher who additionally wants the trait to survive an RFC 7396 `null` deletion SHOULD either list the property in the containing object schema's `required` array (deletion then fails the Completeness check for non-abstract types) or declare a `default` equal to the `const` value (deletion then becomes a no-op, since materialization restores the value before validation). This is the general presence rule for traits — it is not specific to `const`: any optional inherited trait without a `default` can be removed by a descendant.
  - **The presence rule is path-recursive.** For a nested trait property, `required` guards it only while every ancestor object on its path is itself present, because a `properties` subschema (and the `required` inside it) applies only when its object is there. A descendant deletes the *outermost* key of a path with a single `null` patch, which removes the whole subtree and with it every nested `required` and `const` inside. To make a nested trait deletion-resistant, the publisher MUST therefore require **each** segment of the path in its own containing object schema, or declare a `default` on the outermost key that restores the whole subtree. Requiring only the leaf is not a lock. The registry MUST NOT add a path-aware guard of its own: deleting an optional parent is a valid merge and the resulting object is validated as-is.
  - A descendant MAY redeclare a trait value with the same value the ancestor already declared (idempotent restatement).
  - See [`adr/0004-x-gts-traits-merge-strategy.md`](adr/0004-x-gts-traits-merge-strategy.md) for the rationale.

- **Validation**
  - **Completeness check** (OP#13, type-level): For types whose `x-gts-abstract` is not `true`, the registry MUST verify that the *materialized* effective traits object validates against the effective trait-schema using standard JSON Schema validation. "Materialized" means: defaults declared in the effective trait-schema for properties not present in the chain-merged effective traits object are substituted in before validation. If validation fails — in particular, if a `required` property of the effective trait-schema has no chain-assigned value and no default — the type fails OP#13 validation. Completeness is a property of the **type** itself, not of any instance: it is always enforced on the explicit validation endpoints (`/validate-type-schema`, `/validate-entity`), and is additionally enforced at registration **when validation is enabled** (`?validate=true`), per the common pattern described in §9.11.5. For types with `x-gts-abstract: true`, this completeness check is skipped; descendants are expected to close any unresolved required traits. See [`adr/0003-x-gts-traits-completeness.md`](adr/0003-x-gts-traits-completeness.md) for the rationale.
  - If the effective trait schema cannot be satisfied (e.g., contradictory constraints introduced across the chain), schema validation MUST fail.

**Example — descendant override and `const` lock:**

Consider a 3-level chain: `base → audit_event → most_derived_event`.

- `base.x-gts-traits-schema.properties.indexed.const = true` — the publisher locks `indexed`.
- `audit_event.x-gts-traits` sets `topicRef = gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~x.core._.audit.v1`.
- `most_derived_event.x-gts-traits` sets `topicRef = gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~x.core._.notification.v1`.

Effective traits for `most_derived_event`: `{ "indexed": <chain-derived true>, "topicRef": ".../notification.v1" }`. The override of `topicRef` is permitted (last-wins). If `most_derived_event` also tried to set `"indexed": false`, registration would fail — not because of a GTS-specific immutability rule, but because the materialized effective traits object would not satisfy the `const: true` constraint declared on `indexed` in the effective trait-schema.

These rules are intentionally aligned with existing JSON Schema composition semantics and GTS schema chaining practices.

See `./examples/events/types/` for complete examples demonstrating trait definition and resolution.

### 9.8 - YAML support

Accept and emit both JSON and YAML (`.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`) for schemas and instances.
Ensure conversions are lossless; preserve `$id`, `gtsId`, and custom extensions like `x-gts-instance-ref`.

### 9.9 - TypeSpec support

Support generating JSON Schema and OpenAPI from TypeSpec while preserving GTS semantics.
Ensure generated schemas use GTS identifiers as `$id` for types and keep any `x-gts-*` extensions intact.

### 9.10 - UUID as object IDs

Support UUIDs (format: `uuid`) for instance `id` fields.

### 9.11 - GTS Type Schema Modifiers (`x-gts-final` / `x-gts-abstract`)

A **schema modifier** is a boolean annotation on a GTS Type Schema that restricts how the type participates in the GTS type system. Modifiers can be used to control inheritance and instantiation behavior. There are two keywords for this purpose: `x-gts-final` and `x-gts-abstract`.

#### 9.11.1 Keywords

| Keyword | JSON type | Purpose | Typical location |
|---------|-----------|---------|------------------|
| **`x-gts-final`** | `boolean` | Marks the type as **not inheritable** — no derived schemas may reference it as a base | Leaf schemas; enum-like types with a fixed set of well-known instances |
| **`x-gts-abstract`** | `boolean` | Marks the type as **not directly instantiable** — instances must conform to a concrete derived type | Base/ancestor schemas that serve purely as templates |

**Schema annotation keywords:** Both `x-gts-final` and `x-gts-abstract` have GTS meaning only in JSON Schema documents (documents with `$schema`). In instance documents, fields with these names are ordinary data and have no GTS modifier semantics unless the instance's own JSON Schema assigns constraints to them.

**Allowed values:** The only meaningful value is `true`. If the keyword is absent or set to `false`, it has no effect (the schema behaves normally — both inheritable and instantiable). Implementations MUST reject non-boolean values.

**Mutual exclusion:** A schema MUST NOT declare both `"x-gts-final": true` and `"x-gts-abstract": true`. This combination is semantically meaningless (a type that can be neither inherited from nor instantiated serves no purpose) and MUST be rejected during schema registration or validation.

| Modifier combination | Inheritance allowed? | Direct instances allowed? |
|---|---|---|
| *(default / neither)* | Yes | Yes |
| `x-gts-abstract: true` | Yes | No |
| `x-gts-final: true` | No | Yes |
| Both `true` | **INVALID** — MUST be rejected | — |

#### 9.11.2 `x-gts-final` semantics

When a schema declares `"x-gts-final": true`:

1. **Registration guard**: When a new schema is registered whose **`$id` chain** references a final type as a base, the registry MUST reject the registration (when validation is enabled). Specifically, if the derived schema's `$id` is of the form `gts://gts.A~B~` and schema `A~` has `"x-gts-final": true`, then registering `A~B~` MUST fail. This is determined from the chained `$id` alone — it does not depend on whether the derived schema body uses `allOf` to reference the parent.

2. **Validation via `/validate-type-schema` (OP#12)**: When validating a derived schema against its base chain, if any base schema in the chain is marked `x-gts-final`, validation MUST fail with an error indicating that the base type is final and cannot be extended.

3. **Instances are unaffected**: A final type MAY have well-known instances and anonymous instances. `x-gts-final` restricts only schema derivation, not instantiation.

4. **No propagation**: `x-gts-final` applies only to the schema that declares it. It does NOT propagate to base types in the chain. For a chain `A~ → B~ → C~`, if `B~` is final, then `C~` is invalid. But `A~` can still be inherited by types other than `B~`'s descendants.

5. **Keyword placement**: The keyword MUST appear at the **top level** of the JSON Schema document, adjacent to `$id` and `$schema` — NOT nested inside an `allOf` entry or any other subschema. A misplaced occurrence MUST be rejected (fail fast). The same applies to `x-gts-abstract` (§9.11.3 item 6) and the trait keywords (§9.7.1).

```json
{
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.infra.compute.vm_state.v1~",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "x-gts-final": true,
  "type": "object",
  "properties": { "..." : {} }
}
```

For derived schemas using `allOf`, the keyword MUST appear at the top level, NOT inside the `allOf` entries:

```json
{
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.vendor._.order_event.v1~",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
    { "$ref": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~" },
    { "..." : {} }
  ],
  "x-gts-final": true
}
```

#### 9.11.3 `x-gts-abstract` semantics

When a schema declares `"x-gts-abstract": true`:

1. **Instance registration guard**: When a new instance is registered whose **rightmost type** in the chain is an abstract type, the registry MUST reject the registration (when validation is enabled). For example, if `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~` is abstract, registering a well-known instance `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.vendor._.some_event.v1` MUST fail (the rightmost type is abstract). However, if a concrete derived schema `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.vendor._.order_event.v1~` exists and is not abstract, then registering instance `gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.vendor._.order_event.v1~x.vendor._.order_placed.v1` succeeds.

2. **Validation via `/validate-instance` and `/validate-entity` (OP#6)**: When validating an instance (through either the instance-specific or unified entity endpoint), the system resolves the rightmost type in the chain. If that type is abstract, validation MUST fail.

3. **Schema derivation is unaffected**: An abstract type is explicitly intended to be inherited from. Registering derived schemas from an abstract type always succeeds (subject to other validation rules).

4. **No propagation**: A derived type is concrete by default. If `A~` is abstract and `B~` derives from `A~`, `B~` is concrete unless it also declares `"x-gts-abstract": true`.

5. **Anonymous instances**: For combined anonymous instance IDs like `gts.A~<UUID>`, the system resolves the type from the prefix. If that type is abstract, the instance MUST be rejected.

6. **Keyword placement**: Like `x-gts-final` (§9.11.2 item 5), `x-gts-abstract` is a type-level modifier and MUST appear at the **top level** of the JSON Schema document, adjacent to `$id` and `$schema` — NOT inside an `allOf` entry (or any other subschema). A subschema is not "the type"; placing the modifier there is a misplacement and MUST be rejected during schema registration or validation.

#### 9.11.4 Interaction with `x-gts-traits`

- **Completeness keyed on `x-gts-abstract`**: A type whose `x-gts-abstract` is not `true` MUST satisfy trait completeness at registration (see §9.7.5). A type with `x-gts-abstract: true` is exempt — abstract types may have unresolved required traits; descendants are expected to close them. See [`adr/0003-x-gts-traits-completeness.md`](adr/0003-x-gts-traits-completeness.md).

- **Final types follow the non-abstract rule**: A type with `x-gts-final: true` is non-abstract by definition (abstract+final is rejected per §9.11.1) and therefore subject to the completeness check. Because no further descendants are permitted, completeness must be satisfied by the final type itself — by chain-inherited values, locally declared `x-gts-traits`, or `default`s in the effective trait-schema.

- **Abstract types may declare `x-gts-traits-schema`**: Doing so contributes to the effective trait-schema of descendants; the abstract type itself is not required to provide values.

#### 9.11.5 Registration enforcement

Enforcement follows the same pattern as existing `?validate=true` behavior: checks are performed when validation is enabled on registration, and always enforced on explicit validation endpoints (`/validate-type-schema`, `/validate-instance`, `/validate-entity`). This is consistent with existing patterns (e.g., the GTS reference keyword checks in section 9.6).

See `./examples/typespec/vms/types/states/gts.x.infra.compute.vm_state.v1~.schema.json` for an example of a final type, `./examples/modules/types/gts.x.core.modules.capability.v1~.schema.json` for another final type, and `./examples/events/types/gts.x.core.events.type.v1~.schema.json` for an example of an abstract base type.


## 10. Collecting Identifiers with Wildcards

**Important:** An identifier containing a wildcard (`*`) is a **pattern for matching** and may not serve as a canonical identifier for a type or instance.

A single wildcard (`*`) character can be used to find all identifiers matching a given prefix. The wildcard is a greedy operator that matches any sequence of characters after it, including the empty sequence and the `~` chain separator. Consequently, a bare chain-suffix wildcard such as `type.v1~*` matches `type.v1~` itself as well as identifiers derived from it.

**Rules for using wildcards:**
1. The wildcard (`*`) must be used only **once**.
2. The wildcard must appear at the **end** of the pattern.
3. The wildcard must not be used in combination with an attribute selector (`@`) or query (`[]`).
4. The pattern must start at the beginning of a valid segment. For example, `gts.x.llm.chat.msg*` is invalid if `msg` is not a complete segment. `gts.x.llm.chat.message.v*` is valid because `v` is the start of the version segment.
5. **Minor version semantics**: When a pattern specifies only a major version (e.g., `v0.*`), it matches candidates with any minor version of that major version (e.g., `v0.1~`, `v0.2~`, etc.). This is because the minor version is optional, and omitting it semantically means "any minor version".

**Valid Examples:**

Given the following identifiers:
```
gts.x.llm.chat.message.v1.0~
gts.x.llm.chat.message.v1.0~x.llm.system_message.v1.0~
gts.x.llm.chat.message.v1.1~
gts.x.llm.chat.message.v1.1~x.llm.user_message.v1.1~
```

- **Pattern:** `gts.x.llm.chat.message.*` - Find all base schemas versions and their derived schemas
  - **Result:** All four identifiers listed above.

- **Pattern:** `gts.x.llm.chat.message.v1.*` - Find all base and deriver types from v1 (any minor version)
  - **Result:** All four identifiers (matches both `v1.0~` and `v1.1~` because pattern without minor version matches any minor version)

- **Pattern:** `gts.x.llm.chat.message.v1~*` - Find all derived types from v1 (any minor version)
  - **Result:** two derived entities: `gts.x.llm.chat.message.v1.0~x.llm.system_message.v1.0~`, `gts.x.llm.chat.message.v1.1~x.llm.user_message.v1.1~`

- **Pattern:** `gts.x.llm.chat.message.v1.0~*` - Find all derived types (schemas) down the chain
  - **Result:** Only one matching entity: `gts.x.llm.chat.message.v1.0~x.llm.system_message.v1.0~`


**Minor Version Matching Examples:**

The following examples demonstrate the special case where patterns without minor versions match candidates with any minor version:

```
Pattern:   gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0~*
Candidate: gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0.1~
Result:    ✅ MATCH (pattern v0~ matches any v0.x)

Pattern:   gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0~*
Candidate: gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0~
Result:    ✅ MATCH (exact match)

Pattern:   gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0.1~*
Candidate: gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0.1~
Result:    ✅ MATCH (exact match with minor version)

Pattern:   gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0~abc.*
Candidate: gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0.1~
Result:    ❌ NO MATCH (pattern v0~abc.* does not match any v0.x)

Pattern:   gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0.1~*
Candidate: gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0.2~
Result:    ❌ NO MATCH (different minor versions)

Pattern:   gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v0~*
Candidate: gts.vendor.pkg.ns.type.v1.0~
Result:    ❌ NO MATCH (different major versions)
```

**Invalid Pattern Examples:**
- `gts.x.llm.chat.msg*` - Invalid if `msg` is not a complete segment.
- `gts.x.llm.chat.message.v*~*` - Multiple wildcards are used.


## 11. JSON and JSON Schema Conventions

### 11.0 Relationship to JSON Schema

GTS Type Schemas **extend JSON Schema** with a vendor keyword set (`x-gts-*`) and a set of **registry-enforced semantic rules** (see §3.2 derivation, §9.11 modifiers, OP#12 derivation compatibility, OP#13 trait validation). GTS does **not** impose additional syntactic restrictions on the standard JSON Schema body: any syntactically valid JSON Schema body that carries a valid GTS `$id` is a syntactically valid GTS Type Schema. The constraints GTS does enforce on document structure concern only its own `x-gts-*` keywords in GTS Type Schemas. Four of them are **document-level**: `x-gts-final`, `x-gts-abstract`, `x-gts-traits-schema`, and `x-gts-traits` MUST appear at the document top level and are rejected when misplaced (§9.7.1, §9.11). The **field-level** reference keywords `x-gts-type-ref` and `x-gts-instance-ref` are assertions on the value at their schema location and MAY appear at any schema location (§9.6.1). Implementations MUST treat the GTS keywords described in this specification as layered on top of the underlying JSON Schema dialect's semantics, alongside the standard JSON Schema keywords (`$id`, `$ref`, `allOf`, `const`, …) used here.

**Dialect-agnostic.** GTS does not pin Type Schemas to a single JSON Schema draft. The dialect of any concrete GTS Type Schema is set by its `$schema` URI, and implementations MUST honour that dialect when validating or interpreting the schema body. The reference examples in this specification declare `$schema: http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#` because Draft-07 has the broadest tooling support and is the safest baseline for cross-vendor interoperability; however, Type Schemas that declare a later dialect — Draft 2019-09 (`https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/schema`) or Draft 2020-12 (`https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema`) — are equally valid GTS Type Schemas. Authors who wish to use post-Draft-07 keywords (`$defs`, `prefixItems`, `unevaluatedProperties`, `unevaluatedItems`, `$dynamicRef`/`$dynamicAnchor`, `dependentRequired`, `dependentSchemas`, …) MAY do so, provided the dialect declared in `$schema` admits those keywords and the GTS-specific rules (derivation compatibility per OP#12, trait validation per OP#13, modifiers per §9.11) are satisfied.

This specification does **not** publish a dedicated GTS meta-schema or `$schema` URI; `x-gts-*` keywords are vendor extensions layered over whichever JSON Schema dialect a Type Schema declares. GTS Type Schemas are therefore **not** a [JSON Schema Dialect](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#dialect) in the formal sense — all GTS-specific constraints are enforced at the registry, not by a meta-schema. Whether a future revision will eventually publish a dedicated `$schema` URI and meta-schema (and thereby make GTS a Dialect formally) is an open question; this specification does not commit to that path.

JSON Schema has no native concept of derivation or inheritance — its closest primitive, [`allOf`](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/combining#allof), is a logical AND over [subschemas](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#subschema) at instance-validation time. In GTS, derivation is expressed by the **chained `$id`** (e.g., `gts://A~B~`); the schema body MAY use `allOf` with a `$ref` to the parent — which is convenient for avoiding duplication of the parent's fields and constraints in the derived schema — but is **not strictly required**. A derived schema that re-declares the parent's fields directly without `allOf` is admissible, provided it satisfies derivation compatibility (OP#12). See [`adr/0001-derivation-form.md`](adr/0001-derivation-form.md) for the full discussion.

- Reusable subschemas inside a GTS Type Schema SHOULD be placed under the canonical container for the dialect declared by `$schema`: `definitions` for Draft-07, `$defs` for Draft 2019-09 and later. Local JSON Pointer references such as `"$ref": "#/definitions/Foo"` (Draft-07) or `"$ref": "#/$defs/Foo"` (Draft 2019-09+) are the recommended form.

### 11.1 Global rules: schema vs instance, normalization, and document categories

This section defines recommendations for how GTS-aware systems interpret JSON documents. The rules describe the concepts; the exact field names used for instance IDs and instance types are **implementation-defined** and may be **configuration-driven** (different systems may look for identifiers in different fields).

#### Rule A — Schema vs instance discriminator

**A JSON document is a schema if and only if it contains a top-level `$schema` field.**

- If `$schema` is present → the document MUST be treated as a **schema**.
- If `$schema` is absent → the document MUST be treated as an **instance**.

This discriminator MUST be applied before any ID parsing heuristics.

#### Rule B — GTS schema `$id` normalization

For GTS schemas (documents with `$schema`), it is recommended that `$id` is URI-compatible by using:
- `$id: "gts://<canonical-gts-id>"`

Implementations MUST normalize this by stripping the `gts://` prefix when extracting/returning the canonical GTS identifier. The `gts://` prefix exists only to make `$id` URI-compatible.

#### Rule C — JSON document categories

Implementations MUST clearly distinguish the following **five** categories of JSON documents:

1. **GTS Type Schemas**
   - Have `$schema`
   - Have `$id` starting with `gts://` and the remainder is a valid **GTS Type Identifier** (ends with `~`)
   - This is the canonical JSON representation of a GTS Type Schema. Files named `*.schema.json` carry such documents.
   - Example:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~",
  "type": "object"
}
```

2. **Non‑GTS schemas**
   - Have `$schema`
   - Do not have a valid GTS `$id`
   - Handling is **implementation-defined** (ignore vs error depending on API context)
   - Example:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "https://example.com/schemas/order.json",
  "type": "object"
}
```

3. **Instances of unknown / non‑GTS schemas**
   - No `$schema`
   - GTS Type cannot be determined (no acceptable GTS Type reference field found, or the field value is not a valid GTS ID)
   - Handling is **implementation-defined** (ignore vs error depending on API context)
   - Example:

```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "payload": { "foo": "bar" }
}
```

4. **Well-known GTS instances (named)**
   - No `$schema`
   - Instance is identified by a **GTS Instance Identifier** (often a chain) stored in an implementation-chosen instance-ID field
   - The GTS Type is derived from the **left segment(s)** of the chain
   - Example (well-known topic/stream instance):

```json
{
  "id": "gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~x.commerce._.orders.v1.0",
  "name": "orders"
}
```

> NOTE: In this specification, a GTS Instance Identifier is a GTS identifier **without** the trailing `~` (i.e., it does not name a GTS Type).
> Some systems may still accept an `id` field or its equivalent that contains a **GTS Type Identifier** (ending with `~`) and treat it as a *GTS Type reference* rather than a *GTS Instance Identifier*.
> This behavior is **not defined by the GTS spec** and is entirely **implementation-specific / configuration-driven**.

5. **Anonymous GTS instances**
   - No `$schema`
   - Instance `id` is opaque (typically UUID)
   - GTS Type is provided separately via an implementation-chosen GTS Type Identifier field (e.g., `type`, `gtsType`, `gts_type`)
   - Example (anonymous event instance):

```json
{
  "id": "7a1d2f34-5678-49ab-9012-abcdef123456",
  "type": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.commerce.orders.order_placed.v1.0~",
  "occurredAt": "2025-09-20T18:35:00Z"
}
```

> NOTE: In this specification, a GTS Type Identifier is a GTS identifier **with** the trailing `~`.
> Some systems may still accept a `type` field or its equivalent that contains a **GTS Instance Identifier** (not ending with `~`). This behavior is **not defined by the GTS spec** and is entirely **implementation-specific / configuration-driven**.


#### ID and type-field heuristics (implementation-defined)

For **instances** (documents without `$schema`), implementations typically apply heuristics in this order:

1. **Try instance ID fields** (commonly `id`, then aliases like `gtsId`, `gts_id`):
   - If the value is a valid GTS identifier, treat it as a **well-known instance** and derive the `type_id` (the GTS Type Identifier) from the chain (everything up to and including the last `~`).
   - Otherwise treat it as an **anonymous instance** ID value.
2. **For anonymous instances**, determine the GTS Type from a separate field (commonly `type`, or aliases like `gtsType`, `gts_type`; `schema` MAY be supported as a legacy alias but is discouraged for new instances).

**Important**: When determining instance type, a chained GTS ID in the instance ID field ALWAYS takes priority over any explicit type field. The type is derived from the chain's type segments, not from a separate type property.

Different systems may choose different field names and priority orders via configuration. The examples below (and the `./examples/*` folders) use the common defaults: `id` for instance ID and `type` for instance type.

#### `type_id` semantics (normative)

The `type_id` returned by extraction/registration APIs (e.g. `/extract-id`) MUST be either a valid **GTS Type Identifier** (ending with `~`) or `null`. It MUST NOT contain any non-GTS value, including JSON Schema dialect URLs (such as `http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#`).

Specifically:

- **Derived GTS schema** (chained `$id`): `type_id` is the **parent GTS Type Identifier** — the chain's left segments up to and including the last `~` of the base.
- **Base GTS schema** (single-segment `$id` with no chain): `type_id` is `null` — a base GTS schema has no GTS parent type.
- **Non-GTS schema** (`$schema` present, no GTS `$id`): `type_id` is `null` — the document is not a GTS entity.
- **Well-known GTS instance** (chained GTS ID in instance ID field): `type_id` is the chain's left segments up to and including the last `~`.
- **Anonymous GTS instance** (UUID `id` + separate `type` field, or combined-anonymous form): `type_id` is the GTS Type Identifier referenced by the `type` field (or derived from the chain prefix in the combined form).
- **Non-GTS instance** (no GTS identifier and no GTS Type reference): `type_id` is `null`.

Implementations MAY expose the JSON Schema dialect URL (`$schema`) separately if needed (e.g., as a distinct `meta_schema` field), but MUST NOT conflate it with `type_id`.

### 11.2 Examples

It is advisable to include instance identifiers in a top-level field such as `id`. However, the choice of the specific field name is left to the discretion of the implementation and can vary from service to service.

**Example #1**: **instance definition** of an object instance (event topic) that has an `id` field that encodes the object type (`gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~`) and identifies the object itself (`x.core.idp.events.v1`). In the example below it makes no sense to add an additional `type` field referring to the object schema because the `id` is already unique and there are no other event topics with the given id in the system:

```json
{
  "id": "gts.x.core.events.topic.v1~x.core.idp.events.v1",
  "description": "User-related events (creation, profile changes, etc.)",
  "retention": "P30D",
  "ordering": "by-partition-key",
}
```

**Example #2**: **instance definition** of an object that has a `gtsId` field that encodes the object type, but also its own integer identifier of the object:

```json
[{
    "id": "123",
    "type": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core.idp.events.v1~",
    "payload": { "foo": "123", "bar": 42 }
},
{
    "id": "125",
    "type": "gts.x.core.events.type.v1~x.core.idp.events.v1~",
    "payload": { "foo": "xyz", "bar": 123 }
}]
```

**Example #3**: **schema definition** of an event type with the `$id` field equal to the type identifier (ending with `~`):

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "gts://gts.x.core.events.type.v1~",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "id": { "type": "string" },
    "timestamp": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time" },
    "payload": { "type": "object" }
  },
  "required": ["id", "payload"]
}
```


## 12. Notes and Best Practices

- Prefer chains where the base system type is first, followed by vendor-specific refinements, and finally the instance.
- Favor additive changes in MINOR versions. Use a new MAJOR for breaking changes.
- Keep types small and cohesive; use `namespace` to group related types within a package.

## 14. Registered Vendors

The GTS specification does not require vendors to publish their types publicly, but we encourage them to submit their vendor codes to prevent future conflicts.

Currently registered vendors:

| Vendor | Description       |
|--------|-------------------|
| x      | example vendor    |
